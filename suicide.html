<section><h2 id="introduction"><a class="deep-link" href="#introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p><strong>Death by suicide is an extremely complex issue that causes pain to hundreds of thousands of people every year around the world. The objective of this data entry is to contribute to an informed, open debate about ways to prevent suicide. If you are dealing with suicidal thoughts you can receive immediate help by visiting resources such as Suicide.org, or by calling 1-800-SUICIDE in the US.</strong></p><p>Every suicide is a tragedy. According to estimates from the World Health Organisation (WHO), over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year. This corresponds to an age-standardized suicide rate of around 11.5 per 100,000 people &#x2013; a figure equivalent to someone dying of suicide every 40 seconds. Yet suicides are preventable with timely, evidence-based interventions.</p><p>The mortality data from the WHO suggest that the prevalence and characteristics of suicidal behavior vary widely between different communities, in different demographic groups and over time. One important source of heterogeneity, both globally and within countries, is gender: suicide rates are much higher for males, particularly in high-income countries.</p><p>Suicide is an extremely complex issue, and while it is not possible to pin down its causes, there are some risk factors that have been identified, mainly through correlations. Mental health, specifically depression, is widely recognized as the most important risk factor. Here we discuss evidence of this and other important correlates that shed light on possible interventions to prevent suicide.</p></section>




<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical View</h2><h3 id="historical-perspective"><a class="deep-link" href="#historical-perspective"></a>Historical perspective</h3><p>Suicide was considered a serious offense in almost all Western European countries from the Middles Ages until (at least) the French Revolution.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> In England, one of the last European countries to decriminalize suicide, &apos;self-murder&apos; was a crime up until 1961.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> In many countries, such as Singapore, it is still considered a crime today. Because of this, historical data on this topic is not easily available; indeed, as we discuss in the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/suicide/#measurement-data-quality">Data Quality</a> section, the stigma surrounding suicide makes measurement difficult even today.</p><h3 id="recent-suicide-mortality-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#recent-suicide-mortality-data"></a>Recent suicide mortality data</h3><p>In the graphs below, we provide estimates of suicide rates from two sources: the World Health Organization (WHO) and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Global Burden of Disease (GBD). WHO estimates extend further back in time to the year 1950, but provide data only to the year 2004/05. In contrast, IHME estimates extend to 1990, but are available to the year 2016. Note that where these two sources overlap, their estimated rates do not necessarily match.</p><h4 id="who-suicide-rates"><a class="deep-link" href="#who-suicide-rates"></a>WHO suicide rates</h4><p>In 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) published the report <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preventing suicide: a global imperative</a>, with the aim of increasing awareness of the public health significance of suicide, as well as making suicide prevention a high priority on the global public health agenda. Using the estimates from the WHO, the following visualization presents suicide rates for different countries over time &#x2013; you can add countries by clicking &quot;add country&quot; in the bottom left of the chart. While most countries do not exhibit clear trends, it is evident that there are marked cross-country differences in levels.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/suicide-rates-by-country" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/suicide-rates-by-country" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/suicide-rates-by-country_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="ihme-suicide-rates"><a class="deep-link" href="#ihme-suicide-rates"></a>IHME suicide rates</h4><p>The visualisation below shows the IHME estimates of age-standardized death rates from suicide/self-harm, measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 people.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/suicide-death-rates" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/suicide-death-rates" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/suicide-death-rates_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="ihme-suicide-rates-by-age"><a class="deep-link" href="#ihme-suicide-rates-by-age"></a>IHME suicide rates by age</h4><p>The visualisation below shows IHME estimates on suicide rates broken down by age category (with the total and age-standardized rates also shown).

Note that this data can be explored for any country using the &quot;change country&quot; function of the interactive graph.</p><p>In 2016, the IHME estimates a total of around 817,000 suicide deaths. This represents a small reduction from the late 1990s where annual deaths were around 850,000-860,000. The largest share of suicides is within the 15-49 year olds category which accounts for approximately 60 percent of deaths.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/suicide-deaths-by-age" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/suicide-deaths-by-age" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/suicide-deaths-by-age_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="gender-differences-in-suicide-rates"><a class="deep-link" href="#gender-differences-in-suicide-rates"></a>Gender differences in suicide rates</h3><p>The fact that cross-country figures do not show clear trends is indicative of the fact that the prevalence and characteristics of suicidal behaviour vary widely between different communities, in different demographic groups and over time.</p><p>The following two visualizations focus on gender differences. The first chart presents trends in suicide rates by gender for a number of countries: we can see that the rates for males do not track those for females. The second visualization shows global differences in gender ratios &#x2013; that is, the ratio of the suicide rate of males to the suicide rate of females. As we can see, in most countries the ratio is larger than one; and male suicide rates are more than 3 times higher than rates for females in most high-income countries. You can switch to the chart view of this graph to explore country-specific trends in more detail.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/male-and-female-suicide-rate" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/male-and-female-suicide-rate" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/male-and-female-suicide-rate_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/Male-Female-Ratio-of-Suicide-Rates?tab=map" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/Male-Female-Ratio-of-Suicide-Rates?tab=map" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/Male-Female-Ratio-of-Suicide-Rates-a42c8357c168ebd03c90930b9d3c439b_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>Gender differences are also markedly different by age. The following graph, produced by Bartolote and Fleischmann (2002)<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> with WHO data, shows that gender gaps are not constant across ages &#x2013; they are largest for middle-aged individuals (45-54 years old) and the elderly (75+ years old).</p><h6>Distribution of suicide rates (per 100,000) by gender and age, 1998 &#x2013;&#xA0;Figure 2 in Bertolote and Fleischmann (2002)<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7864" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-750x469.png" alt="GenderAge Global Rates" width="750" height="469" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-150x94.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-400x250.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-750x469.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge-768x481.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GenderAge.png 1416w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h3 id="attempted-suicide"><a class="deep-link" href="#attempted-suicide"></a>Attempted suicide</h3><p>Reliable cross-country data about the number of attempted suicides each year is not available. In contrast to data on deaths by suicide, no country in the world reports to the WHO official statistics on attempted suicide. However, it is broadly understood that the number of suicide attempts is much higher than the number of actual suicide deaths each year. In fact, available studies from specific countries suggest that individuals who have made prior suicide attempts are at much higher risk of dying by suicide than individuals who have not made prior suicide attempts. According to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150810050632/http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/Suicide_DataSheet-a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">figures published by the Centers for Disease Control</a>, in the US there are roughly 25 attempts for each suicide death; and for young adults aged 15-24 the ratio is much higher: there are approximately 100-200 suicide attempts for each suicide death.</p><h3 id="means-of-death-by-suicide"><a class="deep-link" href="#means-of-death-by-suicide"></a>Means of death by suicide</h3><p>Understanding the prevalence of different means of death by suicide is important from a public policy perspective, because restricting access to the means of suicide is a key component of suicide prevention efforts. Indeed, one of the first steps in coping with suicidal thoughts at the individual level is to restrict access to elements that can be used to hurt oneself (see <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/suicide-help-dealing-with-your-suicidal-thoughts-and-feelings.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpguide.org</a> for a complete list of steps).</p><p>Unfortunately, given the extreme stigma attached to suicide in most countries &#x2013; and the fact that it is often considered inappropriate to enquire or publish details in cases of death by suicide because of the effect that this may have on others &#x2013; there is little systematic evidence documenting the prevalence of different methods. According to the WHO, the best way for researchers and policymakers to assess the patterns of suicide methods is to rely on data published in the scientific literature. A systematic review of world data for 1990&#x2212;2007 estimated that around 30% (within a plausible range of 27&#x2212; 37%) of global suicides are due to pesticide self-poisoning, most of which occur in low and middle income countries.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> This makes it one of the most common methods of suicide globally.</p><p>Other academic research has documented community-specific epidemics, such as the case of use of barbecue charcoal to produce carbon monoxide as a means of suicide in China. In this specific instance, the epidemic began in 1998 in Hong Kong, from where it rapidly spread to Taiwan, where it became the most common method of suicide within eight years.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><h3 id="suicide-and-the-internet"><a class="deep-link" href="#suicide-and-the-internet"></a>Suicide and the internet</h3><p>The internet is a powerful resource for those seeking help when dealing with suicidal thoughts. Understanding how people seek such help can be very informative about possible ways to prevent suicide. Specifically, aggregated data stored by search engines can be a powerful source of information to understand and prevent suicide. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a>, for instance, allows anyone to explore the popularity of specific search terms that may be linked to specific suicidal behavior &#x2013; almost in real time.</p><p>The following visualization presents three scatter plots documenting the relationship between the popularity of the search terms &quot;suicide help&quot;, &quot;how to suicide&quot; and &quot;how to overdose&quot;. These charts plot Google Trends data on the worldwide popularity of the above-mentioned search terms, where popularity is measured by Google as the ratio between the number of searches for a term in any given week, and the number of all searches in that week (see the <a href="https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4355164?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=4365530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> from Google for further details). Each point in these scatter plots corresponds to a different week in the period January 2004 - June 2016. As we can see, there are striking positive correlations suggesting that (i) search for help tends to go together with search for information on means of suicide; and (ii) search for information on means of suicide tends to go together with queries on drug abuse. Clearly, the individuals using Google are not representative of the world population as a whole &#x2013; certainly not if we restrict our analysis to queries in the English language.</p><p>But these results are indicative of the potential informativeness of data generated by search engines and emphasize how important it is to make help available via the web.</p><h6>Scatter Plots for Google Search Popularity of Terms Related to Suicide<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-328x550.png" alt="Google trends column 01" width="328" height="550" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19446" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-89x150.png 89w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-238x400.png 238w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-328x550.png 328w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01-768x1289.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-trends-column-01.png 1334w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p></section>





































<section><h2 id="correlates"><a class="deep-link" href="#correlates"></a>Correlates</h2><p>Suicide is an extremely complex issue, and while it is not possible to pin down its causes, there are some risk factors that have been identified in the academic literature, mainly through correlations. As always, correlation does not imply causation; but correlation is a valuable starting point to detect risk factors and inform suitable policy interventions.</p><p>Depression and other mood disorders are widely recognized as the most important risk factors for suicide. In this entry we discuss evidence of this, and other factors that correlate with suicide.</p><p>As mentioned before, the objective of this data entry is to contribute to an informed open debate about ways to prevent suicide. <strong>If you are dealing with suicidal thoughts you can receive immediate help by visiting resources such as <a href="http://www.suicide.org/">Suicide.org</a>, or by calling 1-800-SUICIDE in the US.</strong></p><h3 id="mental-health"><a class="deep-link" href="#mental-health"></a>Mental health</h3><p>Depression and other mood disorders are widely recognized among the most important risk factors for suicide. Bertolote and Fleischmann (2002), for instance, provide a systematic review of studies reporting diagnoses of mental disorders for individuals dying from suicide, and discuss the implications of psychiatric diagnosis for suicide prevention.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> They report that 98% of those who died by suicide had a diagnosable mental disorder. The following visualization, taken from their paper, provides details regarding the types of mental disorders in question. The two pie-charts correspond to different population sub-groups: the left chart corresponds to individuals who died by suicide and had been admitted to mental hospitals (labelled as &apos;psychiatric inpatient population&apos;), and the right chart corresponds to individuals who died by suicide but had not been admitted to mental hospitals (labelled as &apos;general population&apos;). Two points are worth emphasizing: (i) mood disorders &#x2013; mainly depression &#x2013; account for the largest share of diagnosed disorders in suicide cases, notably for those individuals who were diagnosed without being admitted to a mental hospital; and (ii) suicide is found associated with a variety of mental disorders.

This can be confusing, since self-harm and suicide are not generally considered to be synonyms.</p><p>The term self-harm is often used by researchers to denote behaviour that is not explicitly intended to lead to death. Some researchers go further and point out that self-harm and suicide attempts should be distinguished, because self-harm tends to involve more frequent but less severe injuries, so the distinction matters for identifying risk factors and providing help.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></p><p>The following diagram, from the <a href="https://www.suicideinfo.ca/resource/self-harm-and-suicide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Centre for Suicide Prevention</a> &#x2013; a branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association &#x2013; provides an idea of how different terms related to self-harm are often used.</p><p>Distinguishing the threshold between &#x2018;low&#x2019; and &#x2018;high&#x2019; intent to die is of course complicated in practice, and because of this, it is not always possible to measure these concepts separately.

This means that the figures are adjusted for the corresponding age structure of the relevant population. This is necessary because the numbers of deaths per 100,000 population are influenced by the age distribution &#x2013; two populations with the same age-specific mortality rates for a particular cause of death will have different overall death rates if the age distributions of their populations are different (for more information see the WHO&apos;s <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/indicatorregistry/App_Main/view_indicator.aspx?iid=78" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indicator and Measurement Registry</a>).</p><h3 id="data-quality"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality"></a>Data quality</h3><p>Data on suicides is deficient for two important reasons. Firstly, there is a problem with the frequency and reliability of vital registration data in many countries &#x2013; an issue undermining the quality of mortality estimates in general, not just suicide. The WHO reports that, of its 172 Member States for which suicide estimates are published, only 60 have good-quality vital registration data that can be used directly to estimate suicide rates. The estimated suicide rates in the other 112 Member States (which account for about 71% of global suicides) are based on modelling assumptions. The following visualization, from the WHO, shows the distribution of mortality data quality around the world. As might be expected, good quality vital registration systems are more likely available in high-income countries.</p><h6>Quality of Suicide Mortality Data&#xA0;&#x2013; Map 2 in WHO (2014)<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7890" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-750x482.png" alt="WHO Suicide Data Quality" width="750" height="482" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-150x96.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-400x257.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-750x482.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality-768x493.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/06/WHO-Data-Quality.png 1538w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p>Secondly, there are problems with the accuracy of the official figures made available to WHO by its Member States, since suicide registration is a complicated process involving several responsible authorities with medical and legal concerns. In spite of the fact that in the International Classification of Diseases the category name and code of suicide has remained relatively stable, it is widely accepted that suicide as a cause of death is hidden and underreported for different reasons, notably social and religious attitudes. Moreover, the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries contributes to under-reporting and misclassification. According to the WHO, suicides are most commonly found misclassified as &#x201C;deaths of undetermined intent&#x201D; and &quot;accidents&quot;.</p></section>
