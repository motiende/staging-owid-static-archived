<p>This article was first published in March 2018. We&apos;d like to thank Sandra Tzvetkova and Diana Beletekian for great research assistance.</p></div><p>In this entry we present data and research on economic inequalities between men and women. Here is an overview of some of the points we cover below:</p><ul>
<li>All over the world men tend to earn more than women. [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#differences-in-pay">Jump to this section</a>]</li>
<li>Women are often underrepresented in senior positions within firms, while at the same time they tend to be overrepresented in low-paying jobs. [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#access-to-top-jobs">Jump to this section</a>] </li>
<li>In many countries men are more likely to own land and control productive assets than women. [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#control-over-household-resources">Jump to this section</a>]</li>
<li>Women often have limited influence over important household decisions, including how their own personal earned income is spent. [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#women-often-have-no-control-over-their-personal-earned-income">Jump to this section</a>]</li>
</ul><p>Whenever the data allows it, we also discuss below how these inequalities have been changing over time. As we show, although economic gender inequalities remain common and large, they are today smaller than they used to be some decades ago.</p><ul>
<li>In most countries the gender pay gap has decreased in the last couple of decades. [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#in-most-countries-the-gender-pay-gap-has-decreased-in-the-last-couple-of-decades">Jump to this section</a>]</li>
<li>Gender-equal inheritance systems, which were rare until recently, are now common across the world. [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#gender-equal-inheritance-systems-have-been-adopted-in-most-but-not-all-countries">Jump to this section</a>]</li>
<li>Composite indices that cover multiple dimensions show that on the whole gender inequalities have been shrinking substantially over the last century. [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#historical-gender-equality-index">Jump to this section</a>]</li>

That is, there is a &apos;gender pay gap&apos;.</p><p>Differences in pay capture differences along many possible dimensions, including worker education, experience and occupation. When the pay gap is calculated by comparing all male workers to all female workers &#x2013; irrespective of differences along these additional dimensions &#x2013; the result is the <strong>&apos;raw&apos;</strong> or <em>&apos;unadjusted&apos; pay gap</em>.</p><p>Cross-country data on the unadjusted gender pay gap is patchy, but the most complete source in terms of coverage is the United Nation&apos;s <em>International Labour Organization</em> (ILO). The following visualization presents this data. You can add observations by clicking on the option &apos;add country&apos; at the bottom of the chart.</p><p>The estimates shown below correspond to differences between average hourly earnings of men and women (expressed as a percentage of average hourly earnings of men), and cover all workers irrespective of whether they work full time or part time.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>As we can see: (i) in most countries the gap is positive; and (ii) there are large differences in the size of this gap across countries.</p><p>(NB. By this measure the gender wage gap can be positive or negative. If it is negative, it means that, on an hourly basis, men earn on average less than women. This is the case in some countries, such as Malaysia.</p><p>A discussion of the <em>adjusted pay gap</em> can be found <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender/#education-and-human-capital">further below in this entry</a>.)</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo?country=CHE+URY+HTI+FRA+CRI+VNM+KOR+PAK+NOR+BRA+DNK+POL+RUS+COL+BEL+ESP" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo?country=CHE+URY+HTI+FRA+CRI+VNM+KOR+PAK+NOR+BRA+DNK+POL+RUS+COL+BEL+ESP" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/gender-gap-in-average-wages-ilo-6a8a1cc60af4e1138de517f8309c2918_v4_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="in-most-countries-the-gender-pay-gap-has-decreased-in-the-last-couple-of-decades"><a class="deep-link" href="#in-most-countries-the-gender-pay-gap-has-decreased-in-the-last-couple-of-decades"></a>In most countries the gender pay gap has decreased in the last couple of decades</h4><p>How is the gender pay gap changing over time? To answer this question, let&apos;s consider the following chart, showing available estimates from the OECD. These estimates include OECD member states, as well as some other non-member countries, and they are the longest available series of cross-country data on the gender pay gap that we are aware of.</p><p>Here we see that the gap is large in most OECD countries, but it has been going down in the last couple of decades. In some cases the reduction is remarkable. In the UK, for example, the gap went down from almost 50% in 1970 to about 17% in 2016.</p><p>These estimates are not directly comparable to those from the ILO, because the pay gap is measured slightly differently here: The OECD estimates refer to percent differences in <em>median</em> earnings (i.e. the gap here captures differences between men and women in the middle of the earnings distribution); and they cover only full-time employees and self-employed workers (i.e. the gap here excludes disparities that arise from differences in hourly wages for part-time and full-time workers).</p><p>However, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-average-wages-2000-vs-2015"> ILO data shows similar trends for the period 2000-2015.</a></p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-oecd?country=AUS+FRA+ITA+JPN+SWE+GBR+USA" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-oecd?country=AUS+FRA+ITA+JPN+SWE+GBR+USA" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/gender-wage-gap-oecd-d82eb5c42f33d5a42f4b3b16f0880d20_v5_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="the-gender-pay-gap-is-larger-for-older-workers"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-gender-pay-gap-is-larger-for-older-workers"></a>The gender pay gap is larger for older workers</h4><p>The <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States Census Bureau</a> defines the pay gap as the ratio between median wages &#x2013; that is, they measure the gap by calculating the wages of men and women at the middle of the earnings distribution, and dividing them.</p><p>By this measure, the gender wage gap is expressed as a percent (median earnings of women as share of median earnings of men) and it is always positive. Here, values below 100% mean that women earn less than men, while values above 100% mean than women earn more. Values closer to 100% reflect a lower gap.</p><p>The next chart shows available estimates of this metric for full-time workers in the US, by age group.</p><p>First, we see that the series trends upwards, meaning the gap has been <em>shrinking</em> in the last couple of decades. Secondly, we see that there are important differences by age.</p><p>The second point is crucial to understand the gender pay gap: the gap is a statistic that changes during the life of a worker. In most rich countries, it&#x2019;s small when formal education ends and employment begins, and it increases with age. As we discuss in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-drives-the-gender-pay-gap">analysis of the determinants</a>, the gender pay gap tends to increase when women marry and when/if they have children.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/womens-weekly-earnings-as-a-percentage-of-mens-by-age-bureau-of-labor-statistics-2017" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/womens-weekly-earnings-as-a-percentage-of-mens-by-age-bureau-of-labor-statistics-2017" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/womens-weekly-earnings-as-a-percentage-of-mens-by-age-bureau-of-labor-statistics-2017_v7_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="the-gender-pay-gap-is-smaller-in-countries-with-low-labor-force-participation-of-women"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-gender-pay-gap-is-smaller-in-countries-with-low-labor-force-participation-of-women"></a>The gender pay gap is smaller in countries with low labor force participation of women</h4><p>The following scatter plot shows available ILO estimates on the gender pay gap (vertical axis) vs GDP per capita (on a logarithmic scale along the horizontal axis). As we can see there is a weak positive correlation between GDP per capita and the gender pay gap.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-wage-gap-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/gender-wage-gap-vs-gdp-per-capita_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>The pattern above needs to be interpreted with caution, since some of the countries with very low wage gaps are also countries with low female participation in labor markets (e.g. Honduras). So rather than reflect greater equality, the lower wage gaps observed in some countries could indicate that only women with certain characteristics &#x2013; for instance, with no husband or children &#x2013; are entering the workforce.</p><p>Olivetti and Petrongolo explain it as follows: &#x201C;if women who are employed tend to have relatively high&#x2010;wage characteristics, low female employment rates may become consistent with low gender wage gaps simply because low&#x2010;wage women would not feature in the observed wage distribution.&#x201D;<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>As we show in the next chart, there is indeed a correlation between female labor force participation and the unadjusted pay gap across countries. And this is true within world regions. For example, in Europe, the countries with the lowest unadjusted pay gap have also the lowest participation of women in labor markets (e.g. Italy).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-hourly-wages-vs-ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gender-gap-in-hourly-wages-vs-ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/gender-gap-in-hourly-wages-vs-ratio-of-female-to-male-labor-force-participation_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="the-gender-pay-gap-is-larger-if-we-account-for-gender-differences-in-employment"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-gender-pay-gap-is-larger-if-we-account-for-gender-differences-in-employment"></a>The gender pay gap is larger if we account for gender differences in employment</h4><p>In all the charts above the gender pay gap is taken only with respect to men and women who are employed. If we estimate the unadjusted pay gap assigning zero income to people who are not employed, we get a much larger pay gap, since <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/employment-to-population-ratio-men-vs-women">employment-to-population ratios tend to be much higher for men than for women</a>.</p><p>The next chart shows the unadjusted pay gaps under this alternative approach whereby individuals who are not employed are assigned zero income. The figures correspond to women&apos;s income as a percent of men&apos;s, and include wages and profits from self-employment.</p><p>Here the gender wage gap is expressed as a percent (average earnings of women as share of average earnings of men) and it is always positive. Values below 100% mean that women earn less than men, and values closer to 100% reflect a lower gap.</p><p>(NB. These figures come from <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/chart-week-gender-pay-gaps-around-world-are-bigger-you-think-and-have-almost-nothing-do-girls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this blog post</a> from the Center for Global Development, where you can find more details and discussion.)</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/unadjusted-gender-wage-gap-including-unemployed" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/unadjusted-gender-wage-gap-including-unemployed" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/unadjusted-gender-wage-gap-including-unemployed_v3_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="access-to-top-jobs"><a class="deep-link" href="#access-to-top-jobs"></a>Access to top jobs</h3><h4 id="women-tend-to-be-underrepresented-in-senior-managerial-positions"><a class="deep-link" href="#women-tend-to-be-underrepresented-in-senior-managerial-positions"></a>Women tend to be underrepresented in senior managerial positions</h4><p>The chart below plots the proportion of women in senior and middle management positions around the world.

Here we show the share of firms that have a woman as manager. We highlight world regions by default, but you can add specific countries by using the option &apos;add country&apos;.</p><p>As we can see, all over the world firms tend to be managed by men. And, globally, only about 19% of firms have a female manager.</p><p>Firms with female managers tend to be different to firms with male managers. For example, <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/how-many-companies-are-run-women-and-why-does-it-matter-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">firms with female managers tend to also be firms with more female workers</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/firms-with-female-top-manager-of-firms-bars" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/firms-with-female-top-manager-of-firms-bars" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/firms-with-female-top-manager-of-firms-bars_v9_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="women-in-rich-countries-tend-to-be-overrepresented-in-low-paying-jobs"><a class="deep-link" href="#women-in-rich-countries-tend-to-be-overrepresented-in-low-paying-jobs"></a>Women in rich countries tend to be overrepresented in low-paying jobs</h4><p>Above we show that women all over the world are underrepresented in high-profile jobs, which tend to be better paid.

In contrast to this, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, and other factors that matter for the pay gap, then the result is the <em>adjusted</em> pay gap.</p><p>The idea of the adjusted pay gap is to make comparisons within groups of workers with roughly similar jobs, tenure and education. This allows us to tease out the extent to which different factors contribute to observed inequalities.</p><p>The following chart, from Blau and Kahn (2017)<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> shows the evolution of the adjusted and unadjusted gender pay gap in the US.</p><p>More precisely, the chart shows the evolution of female to male wage ratios in three different scenarios: (i) Unadjusted; (ii) Adjusted, controlling for gender differences in human capital, i.e. education and experience; and (iii) Adjusted, controlling for a full range of covariates, including education, experience, job industry and occupation, among others. The difference between 100% and the full specification (the green bars) is the &#x201C;unexplained&#x201D; residual.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>Several points stand out here.</p><ul>
<li>First, the unadjusted&#xA0;gender pay gap in the US shrunk over this period.&#xA0;This is evident from the fact that the blue bars are closer to 100% in 2010 than in 1980.</li>
<li>Second, if we focus on groups of workers with roughly similar jobs, tenure and education, we also see a narrowing.&#xA0;The adjusted gender pay gap has shrunk.</li>
<li>Third, we can see that education and experience used to help explain a very large part of the pay gap in 1980, but this changed substantially in the decades that followed. This third point follows from the fact that the difference between the blue and red bars was much larger in 1980 than in 2010.</li>
<li>And fourth, the green bars grew substantially in the 1980s, but stayed fairly constant thereafter. In other words: Most of the convergence in earnings occurred during the 1980s, a decade in which the &quot;unexplained&quot; gap shrunk substantially.</li>
</ul><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16606" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Female-to-male-wage-ratio-01-739x550.png" alt="" width="739" height="550"></a></p><p>Blau and Kahn further break down the wage gap into contributing factors. The following chart shows the relative importance of specific labor market characteristics in 1980 and 2010.</p><p>Now we see that in the US, education and experience have become much less important in explaining gender differences in wages over time, while occupation and industry have become more important.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gender-Pay-Gap-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16607" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gender-Pay-Gap-01-750x522.png" alt="" width="750" height="522"></a></p><h4 id="the-unexplained-residual-is-not-the-same-as-discrimination"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-unexplained-residual-is-not-the-same-as-discrimination"></a>The unexplained residual is not the same as discrimination</h4><p>The chart above shows that the &apos;unexplained&apos; residual went down over the period 1980-2010 in the US. This means the observable characteristics of workers and their jobs explain wage differences better today than a couple of decades ago. At first sight, this seems like good news &#x2013; it suggests that today there is less discrimination, in the sense that differences in earnings are today much more readily explained by differences in &apos;productivity&apos; factors. But is this really the case?</p><p>The unexplained residual may include aspects of unmeasured productivity (i.e. unobservable worker characteristics that cannot be controlled for in a regression), while the &quot;explained&quot; factors may themselves be vehicles of discrimination.</p><p>For example, suppose that women are indeed discriminated against, and they find it hard to get hired for certain jobs simply because of their sex. This would mean that in the adjusted specification, we would see that occupation and industry are important contributing factors &#x2013; but that is precisely because discrimination is embedded in occupational differences!</p><p>Hence, while the unexplained residual gives us a first-order approximation of what is going on, we need much more detailed data and analysis in order to say something definitive about the role of discrimination in observed pay differences. I will discuss the evidence on discrimination further below.</p><h4 id="gender-pay-differences-around-the-world-are-better-explained-by-occupation-than-by-education"><a class="deep-link" href="#gender-pay-differences-around-the-world-are-better-explained-by-occupation-than-by-education"></a>Gender pay differences around the world are better explained by occupation than by education</h4><p>The set of three maps below, taken from the World Development Report (2012), shows that today gender pay differences are much better explained by occupation than by education.

In other words, women, more than men, are expected to have temporal flexibility in their jobs. Things like shifting hours of work and rearranging shifts to accommodate emergencies at home. And these are jobs with lower earnings per hour, even when the total number of hours worked is the same.</p><p>The importance of job flexibility in this context is very clearly illustrated by the fact that, over the last couple of decades, women in the US increased their participation and remuneration in only some fields. In a recent paper, Goldin and Katz (2016)<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> show that pharmacy became a highly remunerated female-majority profession with a small gender earnings gap in the US, at the same time as pharmacies went through substantial technological changes that made flexible jobs in the field more productive (e.g. computer systems that increased the substitutability among pharmacists.)</p><p>The chart below shows how quickly female wages increased in pharmacy, relative to other professions, over the last few decades in the US.</p><h6>Female median earnings of full-time, year-round pharmacists relative to other professions, 1970-2010, US &#x2013; Goldin and Katz (2016)<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16163" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Goldin-female-pharmacy-pay-750x464.png" alt="" width="750" height="464"></a></p><h3 id="the-motherhood-penalty"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-motherhood-penalty"></a>The motherhood penalty</h3><p>Closely related to job flexibility and occupational choice, is the issue of work interruptions due to motherhood. On this front there is again a great deal of evidence in support of the so-called &apos;motherhood penalty&apos;.</p><p>Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen (2017)<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> provide evidence from Denmark &#x2013; more specifically, Danish women who sought medical help in achieving pregnancy.</p><p>By tracking women&#x2019;s fertility and employment status through detailed periodic surveys, these researchers were able to establish that women who had a successful <em>in vitro fertilization</em> treatment, ended up having lower earnings down the line than similar women who, by chance, were unsuccessfully treated.</p><p>Lundborg, Plug and Rasmussen summarise their findings as follows: <em>&quot;Our main finding is that women who are successfully treated by [in vitro fertilization] earn persistently less because of having children. We explain the decline in annual earnings by women working less when children are young and getting paid less when children are older. We explain the decline in hourly earnings, which is often referred to as the motherhood penalty, by women moving to lower-paid jobs that are closer to home.&quot;</em></p><p>The fact that the motherhood penalty is indeed about &#x2018;motherhood&#x2019; and not &#x2018;parenthood&#x2019;, is supported by further evidence:</p><p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24219#fromrss">A recent study</a>, also from Denmark, tracked men and women over the period 1980-2013, and found that after the first child, women&#x2019;s earnings sharply dropped and never fully recovered.

Even when there is generous paid leave and subsidized childcare, as long as mothers disproportionately take additional work at home after having children, inequities in pay are likely to remain.</p><h3 id="ability-personality-and-social-norms"><a class="deep-link" href="#ability-personality-and-social-norms"></a>Ability, personality and social norms</h3><p>The discussion so far has emphasised the importance of job characteristics and occupational choice in explaining the gender pay gap. This leads to obvious questions: What determines the systematic gender differences in occupational choice? What makes women seek job flexibility and take a disproportionate amount of unpaid care work?</p><p>One argument usually put forward is that, to the extent that biological differences in preferences and abilities underpin gender roles, they are the main factors explaining the gender pay gap. In their review of the evidence, Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn (2017)<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> show that there is limited empirical support for this argument.</p><p>To be clear, yes, there is evidence supporting the fact that men and women differ in some key attributes that may affect labor market outcomes. For example standardized tests show that there are <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.95" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> statistical gender gaps in maths scores&#xA0;in some countries</a>; and experiments show that women <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/mnsc.2014.1994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid more salary negotiations</a>, and they often <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20141734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show particular predisposition to accept and receive requests for tasks with low promotion potential</a>. However, these observed differences are far from being biologically fixed &#x2013; &apos;gendering&apos; begins early in life and the evidence shows that preferences and skills are highly malleable. You can influence tastes, and you can certainly teach people to tolerate risk, to do maths, or to negotiate salaries.</p><p>What&apos;s more, independently of where they come from, Blau and Kahn show that these empirically observed differences can typically only account for a modest portion of the gender pay gap.</p><p>In contrast, the evidence does suggest that social norms and culture, which in turn affect preferences, behaviour and incentives to foster specific skills, are key factors in understanding gender differences in labor force participation and wages. You can read more about this in our blog post dedicated to answer the question <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/biology-pay-gap">&apos;How well do innate gender differences explain the gender pay gap?&apos;</a>.</p><h3 id="discrimination-and-bias"><a class="deep-link" href="#discrimination-and-bias"></a>Discrimination and bias</h3><p>Independently of the exact origin of the unequal distribution of gender roles, it is clear that our recent and even current practices show that these roles persist with the help of institutional enforcement. Goldin (1988),<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> for instance, examines past prohibitions against the training and employment of married women in the US. She touches on some well-known restrictions, such as those against the training and employment of women as doctors and lawyers, before focusing on the lesser known but even more impactful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&apos;marriage bars&apos;</a> which arose in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&#xA0;These work prohibitions are important because they applied to teaching and clerical jobs &#x2013; occupations that would become the most commonly held among married women after 1950. Around the time the US entered World War II, it is estimated that 87% of all school boards would not hire a married woman and 70% would not retain an unmarried woman who married.</p><p>The map shown below highlights that to this day, legal barriers to fight discrimination are far from being the norm.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/law-mandate-equal-pay" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/law-mandate-equal-pay" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/law-mandate-equal-pay_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>However, even after explicit barriers are lifted and legal protections put in their place, discrimination and bias can persist in less overt ways. Goldin and Rouse (2000),<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> for example, look at the adoption of &quot;blind&quot; auditions by orchestras, and show that by using a screen to conceal the identity of a candidate, impartial hiring practices increased the number of women in orchestras by 25% between 1970 and 1996.</p><p>Many other studies have found similar evidence of bias in different labor market contexts.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>Biases also operate in other spheres of life with strong knock-on effects on labor market outcomes. For example, at the end of World War II <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/what-percentage-of-the-us-public-approves-of-working-wives">only 18% of people in the US thought that a wife should work if her husband was able to support her</a>. This obviously circles back to our earlier point about social norms.</p></section>























































<section><h2 id="key-definitions"><a class="deep-link" href="#key-definitions"></a>Key definitions</h2><h3 id="what-is-the-gender-pay-gap"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-the-gender-pay-gap"></a>What is the gender pay gap?</h3><p>The gender pay gap (or the gender wage gap) is a metric that tells us the difference in pay (or wages, or income) between women and men. It&apos;s a measure of inequality and captures a concept that is broader than the concept of equal pay for equal work.</p><p>Differences in pay between men and women capture differences along many possible dimensions, including worker education, experience and occupation. When the gender pay gap is calculated by comparing all male workers to all female workers &#x2013; irrespective of differences along these additional dimensions &#x2013; the result is the &apos;raw&apos; or <strong>unadjusted pay gap</strong>. On the contrary, when the gap is calculated after accounting for underlying differences in education, experience, etc., then the result is the<strong> adjusted pay gap</strong>.</p><p>Discrimination in hiring practices can exist in the absence of pay gaps &#x2013; for example, if women know they will be treated unfairly and hence choose not to participate in the labor market. Similarly, it is possible to observe large pay gaps in the absences of discrimination in hiring practices &#x2013; for example, if women get fair treatment but apply for lower-paid jobs.</p><p>The implication is that observing differences in pay between men and women is neither necessary nor sufficient to prove discrimination in the workplace. Both discrimination and inequality are important. But they are not one and the same.</p><h3 id="how-is-the-unadjusted-gender-pay-gap-measured"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-is-the-unadjusted-gender-pay-gap-measured"></a>How is the unadjusted gender pay gap measured?</h3><h4 id="percent-differences-in-average-or-median-earnings"><a class="deep-link" href="#percent-differences-in-average-or-median-earnings"></a>Percent differences in average or median earnings </h4><p>The gender wage gap is often measured as the difference between average earnings of men and average earnings of women expressed as a percentage of average earnings of men. By this measure the gender wage gap can be negative. This is the definition used by the ILO. (We explore the ILO data <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#in-most-countries-there-is-a-substantial-gender-pay-gap">above</a>.)</p><p>Comparisons of averages can often be misleading because averages are very sensitive to extreme data points. Hence, it is also common to measure gender gaps by comparing earnings for the individuals at the <em>median</em> &#x2014; or middle &#x2014; of the earnings distribution. This is the definition used by the OECD. (We explore the OECD data <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender#in-most-countries-the-gender-pay-gap-has-decreased-in-the-last-couple-of-decades">above</a>.)</p><h4 id="ratios-of-average-or-median-earnings"><a class="deep-link" href="#ratios-of-average-or-median-earnings"></a>Ratios of average or median earnings</h4><p>In addition to percent differences, it is also common to express the gender pay gap as a simple ratio between wages. This is the measure adopted by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-people.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">United States Census Bureau</a>.</p><p>By this measure, the gender wage gap is expressed as a percent (median earnings of women as share of median earnings of men) and it is always positive. Here, values below 100% mean that women earn less than men, while values above 100% mean than women earn more. Values closer to 100% reflect a lower gap.</p></section>
