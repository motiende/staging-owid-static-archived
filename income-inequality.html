Most of their estimates (18 of the 28) of pre-industrial inequalities are based on so-called &apos;social tables&apos;. In these tables, social classes (or groups) &apos;are ranked from the richest to the poorest with their estimated population shares and average incomes&apos;.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>The following graph demonstrates the level of economic inequality in&#xA0;pre-industrial societies in relation to the levels of prosperity in those same societies. Inequality is measured with the Gini index (explained <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">below</a>) and prosperity is measured by the&#xA0;gross domestic income&#xA0;per capita, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-PPPs">adjusted for price differences</a>&#xA0;to make comparisons in a common currency possible.</p><p>The graph also shows a curve labelled IPF; this is the <em>Inequality Possibility Frontier</em>. The idea behind this curve is that in a very poor society inequality cannot be very high: Imagine if the <em>average</em> level of income were just the bare minimum to survive, in such an economy there could not possibly be any inequality as this would necessarily mean that some people have to be below the minimum income level on which they could survive.</p><p>When average income is a little higher it is possible to have some small level of inequality, and the IPF shows how the maximum possible inequality increases with higher average income. The authors found&#xA0;that many pre-industrial societies are clustered along the IPF. This means that in these societies, inequality was as high as it possibly could have been.</p><p>In the cases of Holland and England, we see that during their early development they moved away from the IPF and the level of inequality was no longer at the maximum.</p><h6>Pre-industrial inequalities: Gini coefficients, and the Inequality Possibility Frontier<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

</h6><h4 id="how-has-inequality-in-the-uk-changed-over-the-very-long-run"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-has-inequality-in-the-uk-changed-over-the-very-long-run"></a>How has inequality in the UK changed over the very long run?</h4><p>The United Kingdom is the country for which we have the best information on the distribution of income over the very long run. This information is visualized in the below chart. The top panel shows the share of total income going to the top 5% of income earners, and the bottom panel shows the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">Gini coefficients</a>.</p><p>The early estimates are based on social tables,&#xA0;and as with most estimates from the more distant past, there is some concern about how accurate these estimates are.&#xA0;Holmes published a detailed ciritique&#xA0;for one of the most famous tables: Gregory King&apos;s Social Table for England in 1688. Holmes (1977) showed King&apos;s limitations as a social analyst and criticized his social table, arguing that various biases &quot;beguiled him (1) into underestimating the number of families in some of the wealthiest, and fiscally most productive classes; and (2) into underestimating (sometimes grossly) income levels at many rungs above the poverty line.&quot;<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>However, there are ways to take into account these biases, and&#xA0;the estimates shown in the graph below are based on a revision of King&apos;s original estimates conducted by Lindert and Williamson. The authors say that they use &quot;Holmes&#x2019; penetrating critique (1977) to guide our modification of King&#x2019;s tables&quot;.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>The estimates presented in this visualization suggest that inequality in the UK was very high in the past, and did not change much until the onset of industrialization. As we can see, incomes used to be remarkably concentrated: up to 40% of total income went into the pockets of the richest 5%.</p><p>Starting in the late 19th century, income inequality began to decrease dramatically and reached historical lows in the late 1970s. However, during&#xA0;the 1980s inequality increased substantially in the UK and both the Gini and the top income share&#xA0;increased&#xA0;sharply. From the early 1990s onwards, we see that the UK experiences a divergence between what the Gini and the top income shares tell us about inequality. The Gini remained flat over these two decades and, if anything, fell somewhat during this period. This tells us that inequality across the bulk of the distribution has not increased further in the UK. At the very top, however, the evidence shows a different story. We&#xA0;observe that income growth at the very, very top of the income distribution has outstripped the strong growth of incomes across the rest of the distribution.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><h6>More than 700 years of income inequality in the UK measured via income share of the top 5% and Gini, 1980-2010<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a>

Usually the top 1%.</p><p>Historical top income inequality estimates are reconstructed from income tax records, and for many countries these estimates give us insights into the evolution of inequality over more than 100 years. This is much longer than other estimates of income inequality allow (as is the case with estimates that rely on income survey data).</p><p>The fact that income shares are measured through tax records implies that these estimates measure inequality before redistribution through taxes and transfers.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>What we can learn from this long-term perspective is summarized in the visualisation&#xA0;below. Consider the case of the USA,&#xA0;in the&#xA0;left panel. Before the Second World War up to 18% of all income received by Americans went to the richest 1%. After that point, and up until the early 1980s, the share of the top 1% dropped substantially&#xA0;(first quickly, and then more slowly in the 1970s)</p><p>After the 1980s inequality in the USA started increasing, and eventually returned to the level of the pre-war period. We see that this U-shaped long-term trend of top income shares is not unique to the USA. In fact the development in other English-speaking countries, also shown in the left panel, follows the same pattern.</p><p>However, it would be wrong to think that increasing top income inequality is a universal phenomenon. In the right panel&#xA0;we see that in equally rich European countries, as well as in Japan, the development is in fact quite different. The income share of the rich has decreased over many decades, and just like in the English-speaking countries, it reached a low point in the 1970s. In contrast to the English-speaking countries, however, top income shares have not returned to earlier high levels; they have instead&#xA0;remained flat or increased only modestly. The evolution of top&#xA0;income inequality followed an L-shape here. Income inequality in Europe and Japan is much lower today than it was at the beginning of the 20th century.</p><p>A lesson that that we can take away from this empirical research is that political forces at work on the national level are likely important for how incomes are distributed. A universal trend of increasing inequality would be in line with the notion that inequality is determined by global market forces and technological progress. The reality of different inequality trends within countries suggests that the institutional and political frameworks in different countries also play a role in shaping inequality of incomes. This means that rising inequality is most likely not inevitable.</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19898" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Top-Incomes-750x536.png" alt="" width="750" height="536"></a></p><h4 id="inequality-before-or-after-taxes"><a class="deep-link" href="#inequality-before-or-after-taxes"></a>Inequality before or after taxes?</h4><p>It is important to emphasize that the top income measures of inequality that we <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#how-has-inequality-in-high-income-countries-evolved-over-the-last-century">discuss above</a> refer to inequality in the distribution of <em>market</em> incomes.&#xA0;And market incomes are not the same as <em>disposable</em> incomes, because most people pay taxes and receive transfers from the government.</p><p>In many countries governments have <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/taxation/#how-progressive-is-taxation-at-the-top-of-the-income-distribution-in-developed-countries">progressive tax systems</a>. In the US, for example, estimates suggest that 37% of the total sum of income-tax revenues come from the top 1%, while less than 3% comes from the bottom 50%.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>The consequence of progressive taxation is that the inequality of disposable incomes (the incomes that actually reach people&apos;s pockets) is much lower than the pre-tax income that&#xA0;is considered in the&#xA0;research that focusses on top incomes.</p><p>The visualization below shows the difference in Gini coefficients before and after redistribution in the USA. You can add other countries by selecting the option &apos;Add countries&apos;. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#redistribution-through-tax-and-transfer-policies">Below</a> we discuss this data in more detail.</p><p>The two income measures are defined as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Market household income is defined as the sum of labor income (paid employment and self-employment income) and capital income.</li>
<li>Disposable household income is the sum of labor income (paid employment and self-employment income), capital income, transfer income&#x2014;social security transfers (work-related insurance transfers, universal benefits, and assistance benefits) and private transfers&#x2014;, minus income taxes and social security contributions.</li>
</ul><p>Bear in mind that in this chart inequality is measured with the Gini index, an inequality measure that not only looks at the top of the income distribution, but captures the whole distribution as explained <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">below</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/inequality-before-and-after-taxes-and-transfers-Thewissen-et-al-data" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/inequality-before-and-after-taxes-and-transfers-Thewissen-et-al-data" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/inequality-before-and-after-taxes-and-transfers-Thewissen-et-al-data_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="inequality-of-disposable-incomes-over-the-long-run"><a class="deep-link" href="#inequality-of-disposable-incomes-over-the-long-run"></a>Inequality of disposable incomes over the long run</h3><p>Research and discussion of inequality unfortunately suffers from the availability and use of&#xA0;estimates for inequality that combine datasets which cannot and should not be combined. As we explain below there are many different definitions of income, and&#xA0;combining estimates based on different definitions&#xA0;is incorrect.</p><p>The&#xA0;<a href="http://www.chartbookofeconomicinequality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chartbook of Economic Inequality</a> presents empirical&#xA0;estimates that&#xA0;are comparable over time for each particular country. This data is&#xA0;shown in the visualization below.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that these estimates are not fully comparable <em>between</em> countries. Thus it is necessary to refer to the &apos;sources&apos; tab of the chart (where definitions of income measures are listed) before making such comparisons.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/inequality-of-incomes-chartbook" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/inequality-of-incomes-chartbook" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/inequality-of-incomes-chartbook_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="relative-poverty-measures-economic-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#relative-poverty-measures-economic-inequality"></a>Relative poverty measures economic inequality</h4><p>Economic poverty is captured by&#xA0;two&#xA0;distinct&#xA0;concepts: absolute poverty and relative poverty. Absolute poverty is measured with respect to an income level that is fixed in time and across countries. The measure of extreme global poverty that we discuss in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-poverty/">World Poverty</a> is the most&#xA0;important example relating to this concept.</p><p>The concept of relative poverty, on the other hand, is defined with respect to an income level that may change over time and across countries. Most often, relative poverty in a country is measured with respect to the median income in the same country (i.e. the income of the person in the middle of the income distribution). Because it is defined in <em>relative</em> terms, it is a measure of economic inequality.</p><p>The visualization below shows relative childhood poverty. That is, the share of children living in relative poverty. The OECD defines&#xA0;childhood poverty&#xA0;as the share of children living&#xA0;in a household with a&#xA0;post-tax-and-transfer income of less than 50% of the national annual median income (i.e. half of the disposable income of the person in the middle of the distribution).</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Child_Poverty-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9934" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Child_Poverty-1-750x525.png" alt="" width="750" height="525"></a></p><h4 id="how-are-the-incomes-of-the-rich-changing-relative-to-the-incomes-of-the-poor"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-are-the-incomes-of-the-rich-changing-relative-to-the-incomes-of-the-poor"></a>How are the incomes of the rich changing relative to the incomes of the poor?</h4><p>Income inequality in a country is affected by the relative growth of incomes at different points in the income distribution. This is intuitive: inequality will shrink if the incomes of the poor tend to grow faster than the incomes of the rich.</p><p>Studying how income levels evolve across the entire distribution is crucial to understanding how the benefits of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gdp-data/">economic growth</a> are shared in the population.&#xA0;Are some people getting richer while others are getting poorer? Or&#xA0;is economic growth raising the incomes of all?</p><p>The visualization below tracks income levels in the UK at different points in the income distributions. Each line shows the cutoff-incomes for the 10 deciles of the income distribution (i.e. 1st shows you the income that separates the poorest 10% from the next 10% in the income distribution).</p><p>You can see&#xA0;how incomes in the UK have changed across the distribution.&#xA0;The UK experienced a large increase in inequality during the 1980s&#x2014;the incomes of the highest deciles increase while everyone else was left behind. Uneven growth in the years leading up to 1991 meant further increases in inequality. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, more even growth across the distribution has meant little changes in inequality, with rising incomes for everybody.</p><p>By clicking on &apos;Change Country&apos; you can visualize the same data for 26 other countries. The experience of the USA is worth discussing. The bottom&#xA0;half of the income distribution in the USA has not seen any income gains for almost the entire period since 1979 (the short exception are the late 1990s). This makes the USA an extreme case in terms of inequality, and really an outlier in what is happening to incomes across the distribution over time.</p><p>You can find more empirical data and research in our entry dedicated to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/incomes-across-the-distribution/">incomes across the distribution</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/real-disposable-household-income-indexed" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/real-disposable-household-income-indexed" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/real-disposable-household-income-indexed_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="how-does-income-inequality-differ-from-consumption-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-does-income-inequality-differ-from-consumption-inequality"></a>How does income inequality differ from consumption inequality?</h4><p>The visualization below provides a comparison of inequality in consumption and inequality in incomes for a number of middle-income countries.</p><p>As we can see, consumption inequality in almost all countries is lower than income inequality. This is intuitive, since consumption can be smoothed over time, for example, by saving earned income. In principle, saving and borrowing allows agrarian societies to have consumption levels that are less volatile&#x2014;and less reliant on seasonal variation&#x2014;than incomes.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>Saving and borrowing is usually harder at low income levels; so consumption and income measures of inequality tend to be closer for poor populations.

The best source for distributional data with global coverage is the World Bank&apos;s PovcalNet. But even for this source, global coverage comes at the cost of comparability. Crucially, the PovcalNet data relies on consumption surveys for some countries and income surveys for other countries.

In other words, the series in this plot show the evolution of regional averages of inequality levels (Gini coefficients).</p><p>As we can see, Latin America is by far the region with the highest cross-country average inequality levels. And this has been the case for decades: inequality in this part of the world is remarkably persistent. At the turn of the 20th century Latin America was, on average, almost 65% more unequal than the industrialized (high-income) countries.</p><p>Another important point to notice in this chart is that variations across world regions are much larger than variations across time. As it turns out, this is also true for countries: the differences in inequality levels between countries tend to be much larger than the differences in inequality for any given country at different points in time (you can check this by clicking on the &#x2018;Chart&#x2019; tab in the Gini <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/?preview_id=3178&amp;preview_nonce=e3f3526d68&amp;_thumbnail_id=9205&amp;preview=true#world-map-of-economic-inequality">world map above</a>). Keeping this in mind is important to contextualize the debate on increasing inequality in high-income countries.

The US is an exception when it comes to income inequality.</p><p>Research shows that in the US the &apos;ultra-rich&apos; are the group that has experienced the largest income growth in the recent period of growing income inequality. This is shown in the following chart. Each dot along the horizontal axis represents a different percentile in the income distribution, with the height marking the corresponding average level of income growth in the period 1980-2014 (after adjusting for inflation). Red and blue, respectively, show changes in incomes before and after taxes.</p><p>The chart comes from Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2016) and it has received <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html">substantial media coverage</a>.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>As we can see, the poorest individuals in the US have seen no real income growth in the period 1980-2014; while at the very top, the ultra-rich have enjoyed an average annual growth of about 6%.

This doesn&apos;t need to be the case. In fact, as Piketty and co-authors point out, in the US the relationship used to be monotonically <em>decreasing</em>: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-1980-vs-2014.png">independently of where you were in the income distribution, those who were poorer used to enjoy larger income growth</a>.</p><h6>Average annual income growth in the US over the period 1980-2014 &#x2013; Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2016),<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14044" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Piketty-Saez-Zucman-2016-2014-before-and-after-taxes-750x468.png" alt="" width="750" height="468"></a></p><h4 id="inequality-in-latin-america-has-declined-in-the-last-two-decades"><a class="deep-link" href="#inequality-in-latin-america-has-declined-in-the-last-two-decades"></a>Inequality in Latin America has declined in the last two decades</h4><p>We have already noted that Latin America is the world region with the highest income inequality.

As we can see, there has been a generalized downward trend (although levels remain very high).</p><p>The fact that inequality reductions have been widespread is remarkable given the underlying differences between countries.

It declined in fast-growing countries (e.g. Chile and Peru) and slow-growing countries (e.g. Brazil and Mexico). It declined in macro-economically stable countries (e.g. Chile and Peru) and countries recovering from economic crisis (e.g. Argentina). It declined in countries governed by what analysts often consider to be left-leaning political regimes (e.g. Brazil and Chile) and in countries governed by regimes considered to be &#x2018;non-leftist&#x2019; (e.g. Mexico and Peru).</p><p>Lopez-Calva and Lustig (2010) suggest that the main factors contributing to declining inequality in these countries are (i) a decrease in the earnings gap between skilled and low-skilled workers and (ii) an increase in government transfers to the poor. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#correlates-determinants-consequences">Below we explore in more detail these and other commonly cited drivers of within-country inequality</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/income-inequality-in-latin-america" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/income-inequality-in-latin-america" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/income-inequality-in-latin-america_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="global-income-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#global-income-inequality"></a>Global income inequality</h3><p>We have an&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-economic-inequality">entry dedicated to global economic inequality</a>&#x2014;here we want to summarize the most important points.</p><h4 id="global-inequality-increased-for-2-centuries-and-is-now-falling"><a class="deep-link" href="#global-inequality-increased-for-2-centuries-and-is-now-falling"></a>Global inequality increased for 2 centuries and is now falling</h4><p>This chart shows the distribution of annual income among all world citizens.

<li>In 1800 the majority of the world lived in poverty, with incomes similar to the poorest countries in Africa today.

<li>By 1975, 175 years later, the world had changed substantially&#x2014;it was much more unequal. As we can see in the chart below, the world income distribution became &apos;bimodal&apos;: it had the shape of a camel. The world was divided into a poor developing world and a 10-times richer developed world.</li>
<li>Over the following 3 decades, the world income distribution again changed dramatically. The poorer countries, especially in South-East Asia, started catching up. The two-humped camel shape changed into a one-humped &apos;dromedary&apos; shape. World income inequality declined, and the distribution shifted to the right.

Under this line of reasoning, one could argue that globalization increases inequality in rich countries because &#x2018;losers&#x2019; are more likely to be those with low incomes in the first place.</p><p>The available empirical evidence on the causal link between globalization and inequality is not definitive, but does suggest that we might want to take this hypothesis seriously. Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013)<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a>, for example, study the consequences of rising Chinese imports for the US in the period 1990-2007. The visualization below shows a scatter plot of cross-regional exposure to rising imports, against changes in employment. Each dot on this graph corresponds to a different area within the US (&apos;commuting zones&apos;, CZs); the vertical axis shows the percent change in manufacturing employment for working age population; and the horizontal axis shows what the authors predict to be the per-worker exposure of the different areas to rising imports (depending on industrial composition, etc.). As we can see, there is a negative correlation. In fact, the authors go further and suggest that rising Chinese imports in the period 1990-2007 <em>caused</em> higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing manufacturing industries (see the paper for details on the empirical strategy used to determine causality).</p><h6>Change in manufacturing employment by commuting zones in the US, 1990-2007 &#x2013; Figure 2b in Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013)<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a>

</h6><h4 id="what-is-the-link-between-technological-change-and-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-the-link-between-technological-change-and-inequality"></a>What is the link between technological change and inequality?</h4><p>Economists often argue that changes in productive technologies increase inequality. The intuition behind this claim is that technical change favors more skilled workers, replacing tasks previously performed by the unskilled. Atkinson (2015)<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> provides a simple discussion of the economic theory supporting this hypothesis.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p><p>The view that productive technologies increase inequality is supported by descriptive evidence from the past decades, when high-income countries witnessed both major changes in technology&#x2014;including the rapid spread of computers in workplaces&#x2014;and a sharp increase in wage inequality.</p><p>The following graph from Acemoglu (2002)<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a> shows the evolution of the relative supply of college skills, as well as the returns to those skills (the college wage premium).<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></p><p>This graph shows that in the US there was a large increase in the supply of more educated workers during the second half of the 20th century. Since the returns to education increased while supply was also increasing, we can interpret this as evidence in support of the hypothesis that technological change was <em>biased</em> in favour of skilled workers.</p><p>The above remark implies a positive correlation between skill-biased technological change and wage inequality. As always, a correlation does not imply causation&#x2014;we do not know if it was skill-biased technology that specifically <em>caused</em> more inequality. However, the fact that this correlation has been observed in other countries suggests that technology is likely part&#x2014;although only part&#x2014;of the explanation for growing inequality in high-income countries.</p><h6>Relative Supply of College Skills and College Premium, US, 1939-1996 &#x2013; Figure 1 in Acemoglu (2002)<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SkillBiased_Acemoglu-2002.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9231" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SkillBiased_Acemoglu-2002-651x550.png" alt="skillbiased_acemoglu-2002" width="651" height="550"></a></p><h3 id="social-norms-and-bargaining"><a class="deep-link" href="#social-norms-and-bargaining"></a>Social norms and bargaining</h3><h4 id="are-differences-in-productivity-generally-sufficient-to-explain-differences-in-incomes"><a class="deep-link" href="#are-differences-in-productivity-generally-sufficient-to-explain-differences-in-incomes"></a>Are differences in productivity generally sufficient to explain differences in incomes?</h4><p>In the textbook case of employment in efficient markets, wages are determined exclusively by productivity&#x2014;so income inequality follows from differences in productivity.</p><p>Economists usually agree on the fact that the supply and demand forces from the textbook case are important in the real world. Indeed, in the preceding section we argued that trade and technology may increase income inequality precisely by making the skills of some individuals less valuable relative to others.</p><p>However, economists also tend to agree that, while relevant, differences in productivity are not sufficient to explain differences in incomes. Social conventions, for example, also play a crucial role. In the words of Atkinson (2015)<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a> &#x201C;supply and demand determine a range of possible pay, and social conventions determine the location within that range &#x2013; the extent of pay dispersion depends on both elements.&#x201D;</p><p>The implication is that market forces provide only bounds on outcomes, and there is scope for notions of fairness to affect inequality.</p><p>As the below charts show, inequality is not universally viewed as inherently undesirable. The estimates come from the World Values Survey, where people are asked to locate their preferences for inequality in a range from 1 to 10 (where 1 implies agreement with the statement &#x201C;Income should be more equal&#x201D;, and 10 implies agreement with the statement &#x201C;We need larger income differences as incentives for individual effort.&#x201D;) These estimates have been calculated at the global level, as well as at the regional level.<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p><p>The top panel here represents the frequency of responses at each point in the 1-10 scale explained above. As a global average, we see substantial polarization: most people picked one of the extremes (either a high preference for equal incomes, or strong opposition to a reduction in inequality).</p><p>Notice that this polarization is even more pronounced in particular regions. While trends across Europe, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa tend to be roughly similar to the average global pattern of responses; results are more polarized in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, and the Middle East and North Africa. Latin Americans tended to be much more supportive of more equal incomes, whereas the opposite was true in the Middle East.</p><p>In the bottom panel we see how these responses correlate with income. To be specific, we see average responses by income deciles (where 1 on the x-axis is the lowest income decile and 10 the highest). Across all regions, we see that richer individuals tend to be less inclined to favour a reduction in inequality (i.e. they see it as an important incentive); whereas those on lower incomes favour greater equality.</p><p>Regional differences, however, are still significant. In particular, in comparison to global averages, the correlation in Europe &amp; Central Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa is less pronounced; while in East Asia, and most notably South Asia, the correlation is stronger.</p><h6>Views on inequality, by world region and relative income position<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></h6><p><img class=" wp-image-12126 aligncenter" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Views-on-inequality-536x550.png" alt="" width="716" height="735"></p><h4 id="is-there-a-link-between-bargaining-power-and-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#is-there-a-link-between-bargaining-power-and-inequality"></a>Is there a link between bargaining power and inequality?</h4><p>We have already pointed out that differences in productivity are not generally sufficient to explain differences in incomes. This is partly reflected in the fact that worker salaries are often the result of bargaining between unions and firms.</p><p>Card et al. (2004)<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a> use data from the US to compare the average wages of unionized and nonunionized workers with similar skills. The following scatter plot shows their results. The estimates correspond to 1993 data on the hourly earnings of males. Each dot corresponds to a different age-education group (the &#x2018;skill levels&#x2019;), and the units on both axes are mean log wages in 2001 dollars.</p><p>By construction, if union and nonunion workers in a given skill group have the same average wages, the points in this graph will lie on the 45-degree line.</p><p>As we can see, there is a &#x2018;union wage gap&#x2019;, reflected in the fact that most groups are above the 45-degree line. Moreover, this union wage gap appears to be larger for low-wage workers: the points are further above the 45-degree line for low-wage skill groups (those on the left). This is consistent with the hypothesis that unions tend to &quot;flatten&quot; wage differentials across skill groups.</p><p>As usual, we have to be careful in interpreting these results. As Card et al. (2004) point out, &#x201C;there may be unobserved skill differences between union and nonunion workers in different age-education groups that tend to exaggerate the apparent negative correlation between wages in the nonunion sector and the union wage gap.&#x201D;</p><h6>Union Relative Wage Structure in the United States, 1993 &#x2013; Figure 4a in Card et al.

The following two visualizations show this, by comparing the degree of income inequality (Gini coefficients), before and after taxes and transfers.</p><p>The chart at the top provides a static overview across all OECD countries using the latest available estimates (2012-2014 depending on the country). The interactive chart at the bottom plots time-series for individual countries, using the same definitions and data sources.</p><p>In both charts income before redistribution refers to market earnings before taxes and transfers (wages and salaries, self-employment income, capital and property income). Income after redistribution, on the other hand, corresponds to disposable income after taxes and transfers (market income, plus social security, cash transfers and private transfers, minus income taxes). In the 2008 OECD report <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/growingunequalincomedistributionandpovertyinoecdcountries.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Growing unequal? </em></a> you can find further details regarding how incomes are measured.</p><p>As we can see, taxes and transfers do reduce inequality significantly: in all countries there is less inequality after redistribution takes place via taxes and transfers. Interestingly, however, the achieved reductions in inequality vary considerably between countries, and substantial cross-country heterogeneity in inequality remains after redistribution.</p><p>In Northern Europe, for example, within-country Gini coefficients after taxes and transfers are below 0.28.

Here we focus on the proportional magnitude of such reductions.</p><p>The following visualization shows the percentage point reduction in Gini coefficients that OECD countries achieve through redistribution. Here, the definitions of incomes before and after taxes and transfers is the same as in the previous two graphs.</p><p>These estimates show that across the 24 countries covered, taxes and transfers lower income inequality by around one-third on average (equivalent to around 0.15 Gini points). Yet cross-country differences are substantial, with declines ranging from about 45% in Denmark and Sweden, to about 8% in South Korea. The US&#x2014;a country with high baseline levels of inequality&#x2014;achieves a reduction of around 17%, which is almost half of the OECD average.</p><p>Generally speaking, countries that achieve the largest inequality reductions through taxes and transfers tend to be those with the lowest after-tax inequality.</p><p>While informative for the purpose of cross-country comparisons, these results have to be interpreted carefully, since the before-tax distribution of incomes is already the result of choices made by individuals who take taxes and transfers into consideration. Put simply, the before-tax distributions of incomes are likely to be different to the actual distributions of incomes that would be in place if there were no taxes or transfers. This can be clearly explained in the context of pensions: individuals receiving state pensions appear in the data as poor before transfers; but many of them would of course have private pensions if they lived in a country without state transfers.</p><p>Another point to keep in mind when studying these estimates is that inequality is not only reduced by redistribution between individuals at a given point in time, but also by achieving redistribution over the course of life. Indeed, pensions have scope for reducing within-country inequality by allowing redistribution of incomes between generations. The estimates in the chart below reflect this.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/tax-reduction-in-inequality" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/tax-reduction-in-inequality" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/tax-reduction-in-inequality_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="economic-growth"><a class="deep-link" href="#economic-growth"></a>Economic growth</h3><h4 id="what-is-the-link-between-economic-growth-and-inequality"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-the-link-between-economic-growth-and-inequality"></a>What is the link between economic growth and inequality?</h4><p>Over the last decades, a large body of theoretical and empirical research has attempted to determine whether inequality is good or bad for economic growth.</p><p>From a theoretical point of view there are arguments in both directions. It is for example possible that inequality leads to less economic growth via political instability and social unrest. But it is also possible that it leads to more economic growth via higher incentives for people to make productive investments.</p><p>Available OECD data shows that there is a negative correlation between inequality and economic growth across different subnational regions, within Europe, and also within OECD countries in the Americas. The below visualization shows this as well, focusing on Europe.</p><p>This chart is a scatter plot, where each dot represents a different sub-national region. France, for example, is divided here in 22 different regions. For each of these sub-national regions, the vertical axis measures the average annual growth rate of GDP per capita in the period 2008-2012, and the horizontal axis measures inequality in 2007 (Gini coefficients). As we can see, there is a clear negative correlation: regions with more inequality in 2007 experienced less average growth in the subsequent years.</p><p>The above correlation does not imply causation. Indeed, the empirical literature on the causal effect of inequality on economic growth is largely inconclusive. A recent and mainly non-technical review of the literature can be found in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264235120-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OECD (2015), In It Together: Why Less Inequality Benefits All</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/income-inequality-and-growth-in-european-sub-national-regions" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/income-inequality-and-growth-in-european-sub-national-regions" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/income-inequality-and-growth-in-european-sub-national-regions_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>






























































<section><h2 id="key-definitions"><a class="deep-link" href="#key-definitions"></a>Key Definitions</h2><h4 id="the-gini-coefficient"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-gini-coefficient"></a>The Gini Coefficient</h4><p>The Gini coefficient, or Gini index, is a measure of the income distribution of a population. It was developed by Italian statistician Corrado Gini (1884-1965) and is named after him.</p><p>The following figure illustrates the definition of the Gini index: in a population in which income is perfectly equally distributed, the distribution of incomes are represented by the &apos;line of equality&apos; &#x2013; 10% of the population would earn 10% of the total income, 20% would earn 20% of the total income and so on. The &apos;Lorenz curve&apos; shows the income distribution in a population where income is not equally distributed&#x2014;in the example below you see that the bottom 60% of the population earn&#xA0;30% of the total income. The Gini coefficient captures the deviation of the Lorenz curve from the &apos;line of equality&apos; by comparing the areas A and B:</p><p>Gini = A / (A + B)</p><p>This means a Gini coefficient of zero represents a distribution where the Lorenz curve is just the &apos;Line of Equality&apos; and incomes are perfectly equally distributed. A value of 1 means maximal inequality (one person has all income and all others receive no income).</p><h6>Graphical representation of the Gini coefficient</h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Gini-measure-schematic-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14658" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Gini-measure-schematic-1-703x550.png" alt="" width="703" height="550"></a></p><p>For a simpler visual explanation of the Gini coefficient, you can see the right-hand side panel of the above chart only here:</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Gini-measure-schematic_simplified.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-9260" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Gini-measure-schematic_simplified-138x150.png" alt="gini-measure-schematic_simplified" width="138" height="150"></a></p><h4 id="pen-s-parade"><a class="deep-link" href="#pen-s-parade"></a>Pen&apos;s Parade</h4><p>Another interesting way to study distributions is Pen&apos;s Parade, named after&#xA0;Dutch economist Jan Pen (1921-2010).</p><p>The visualisation below shows an example of Pen&apos;s Parade. It is the global distribution of incomes in 2003 and in 2013 as estimated by Hellebrandt and Mauro.<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a></p><p>The metaphor of a parade works well. The idea is that you order the people in a population by the level of their income. The first people in the parade are those with the lowest incomes, and the people with higher incomes make their appearance successively in the parade. Once half of the parade is over we see the&#xA0;person&#xA0;who&#xA0;earns the median income.&#xA0;In a typical distribution, it is only far into the second half of the parade that we see the person with the mean income appear. At the very end of the parade we see the individuals with the highest incomes.</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Global-Inc-Distribution-2003-and-2013-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9498" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Global-Inc-Distribution-2003-and-2013-1-750x525.png" alt="global-inc-distribution-2003-and-2013" width="750" height="525"></a></p></section>

<p>Regarding the construction of the data, Hans and Ola Rosling note the following <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/news/data-sources-dont-panic-end-poverty/">here</a>: "This graph is constructed by combining data from multiple sources. In summary, we take the best available country estimates for the three indicators: GDP per capita, Population and Gini (which is a measure of income inequality). With these numbers we can approximate the number of people on different income levels in every country. We then combine all these approximations into a global pile using the method described below under The Adjusted Global Income Scale."</p></li><li id="note-15"><p>The data was made available to Our World In Data by the two authors.
