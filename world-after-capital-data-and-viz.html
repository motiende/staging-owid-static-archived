Positive values indicate an increase in prices since 1997, and negative values represent a price decline. Here we see a distinct divide between consumer durables and technologies (which have typically seen a price decline), and service-based purchases (which have increased in price).</p><p>A combination of industrial offshoring, technological innovation and economies of scale have resulted in a price decline in goods such as televisions (-96% since 1997), software (-67%), toys (-69%), and clothing (-4%). In contrast, the prices of goods and services such as education, childcare, medical care, and housing have increased significantly, rising by 150%, 110%, 100% and 58%, respectively.</p><p>The observed rise in costs of services may be partly attributed to the so-called &#x2018;<a href="http://www.robertoformato.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/03-Baumol-cost-disease-by-Heilbrun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baumol&#x2019;s cost disease</a>&#x2018;, which is an important exception from the general regularity that the&#xA0;pay for labor &#x2013; the wage &#x2013; reflects the productivity of labor. Baumol&#x2019;s cost disease describes the phenomenon whereby wages rise in jobs which have experienced little improvements in labor productivity in order to compete with salaries in other sectors.</p><p>Examples of service-based roles such as nursing, healthcare, childcare and education have experienced little productivity growth relative to manufacturing sectors which have seen continued improvements through technological innovation. In order to retain employees in service-based roles, salaries have risen in order to remain competitive with industrial sectors; this increase in pay has occurred despite minimal gains in productivity. This may in part explain why the cost of education, healthcare and other services have risen faster than the general rate of inflation.&quot;</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="healthcare-spending-per-capita"><a class="deep-link" href="#healthcare-spending-per-capita"></a>Healthcare spending per capita</h3><p>In the chart below we have mapped (and can also be viewed in &quot;chart&quot; mode) per capita healthcare expenditure by country.

Having crunched the numbers on this, we are pretty sure the graph from the <a href="https://medium.com/@YondonFu/non-linearities-6c3ac8d8e2bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium article</a> you linked to is incorrect. We got another member of our team, who did his degree in exactly this field to take a look over this, and he has confirmed that the article has majorly overestimated the costs of sequencing.

Details of the conversion factor I used are in the &quot;sources&quot; tab of the chart.</p><p>You are more than welcome to use this- the data is perfectly valid in any case- but it&apos;s probably worth noting that the cost of lab-grown meat at the moment is exactly that: the cost of production at a very small lab scale. There are likely to be significant (and possibly economically challenging) issues in terms of scaling this up to a level close to commercial-scale. Knowing a little about synthetic proteins and meats personally, I see this to be incredibly challenging. This transition (which is likely reflected in other select technologies) could be quite complex from the perspective of rates of technological progress, economies of scale and the overall economics of production. I hope to develop a much better understanding of the different elements of technological progress for future work at OurWorldinData, so cannot really offer a more concrete explanation of what this transition across the scales of production may look like at the moment.</p><p>I have tried to be explicit in the subtitle of this chart (and in the source tab) that this the costing for lab-scale production. It is still an example of rapid progress, regardless, so you can see if it fits in with your book at some stage.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/price-of-lab-grown-beef-vs-retail-beef-2013-2017" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/price-of-lab-grown-beef-vs-retail-beef-2013-2017" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/price-of-lab-grown-beef-vs-retail-beef-2013-2017_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>
