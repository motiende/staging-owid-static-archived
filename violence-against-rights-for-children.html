These other factors covered baseline behavior problems (as rated by the teacher),  mental health, stress levels and parenting style (as defined by parents&apos; answers to interview questions).</p><p>The study reports that children who experienced violent discipline at age 5 were more likely to have behavior problems later on, according to teachers&#x2019; ratings. The study also found that the link between corporal punishment and misbehavior was even stronger if parents said that they had spanked their child the week before the survey, which may be considered a sign of relatively frequent spanking.</p><p>To the extent that these results are hard to explain by alternative hypothesis, this is arguably the best evidence we have (outside of an experiment, which is of course not feasible in this context) about the likely negative effects of corporal punishment on children&apos;s behavior.</p><p>You can read a summary of this study in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spanking-for-misbehavior-it-causes-more-1513267680" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this overview article in The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p><h4 id="child-violence-affects-health-and-education-outcomes"><a class="deep-link" href="#child-violence-affects-health-and-education-outcomes"></a>Child violence affects health and education outcomes</h4><p>A recent study used detailed household surveys from South Africa and Malawi to document the prevalence of violent discipline and subsequent changes in school progress among those affected. The study found that children who were exposed to psychological and physical violence for discipline were more likely to have dropped out of school upon follow-up (Sherr et al. 2015).<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> Other studies have found that violence against children also correlates with poor educational outcomes in the long run. In rich countries, for example, studies have found that individuals who are exposed to sexual and physical abuse in childhood are more likely to drop out of college (Boden et al 2007 and Duncan 2000).<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p>Physical and psychological abuse are often linked to negative effects on mental and physical health. For example, it has been documented that anxiety and depression tend to arise more frequently among children who are abused.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> As usual, these correlations do not imply causation. But there are good reasons to take them seriously. The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Development Report (2018)</a> notes that toxic stress in the early years can undermine lifelong health, learning, and behavior, because the hormones associated with the fight-or-flight response, such as cortisol, can inhibit physical growth and the children&#x2019;s susceptibility to illness. It is also the case that these hormones can impair the development of neural connections in parts of the brain that are critical for learning.</p><p>The following is an example of the type of brain development problems that researchers attribute to sensory neglect in early childhood. The source is Perry (2002).<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> The CT scan on the left is an image from a healthy three year old with a typical head size (at the 50th percentile of the distribution). The image on the right is from a three year old child suffering from &apos;severe sensory-deprivation neglect&apos; &#x2013; minimal exposure to language, touch, and social interactions. The brain of the child on the right is significantly smaller than average (3rd percentile) and has signs of deterioration (cortical atrophy).</p><p>Of course, this comparison is just an illustration, and it is hard to know with certainty whether the observed differences in brain size can be fully attributed to sensory-deprivation neglect. However, Perry finds that the average head size among a group of 40 children who had suffered sensory neglect is below the 5th percentile in the distribution &#x2013; and while some recovery in brain-size was observed after children were removed from the neglectful environment, in most cases the gaps remained significant.</p><p>These findings are relevant to child development because brain malleability is much greater earlier in life, and brain development is sequential and cumulative; which means that brain deterioration can lead to permanent impairments on skill acquisition.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><h6>Brain scan from a non-neglected child with an average head size (left) in comparison to a scan from a child suffering from severe sensory-deprivation neglect (right) &#x2013;&#xA0;Perry (2002)<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13857" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-750x499.png" alt="Ct scan neglect" width="750" height="499" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-150x100.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-400x266.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-750x499.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect-768x511.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CT-Scan-Neglect.png 874w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p>You can read more about these correlates and consequences in our blog post dedicated to <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/child-maltreatment-and-educational-outcomes/">child maltreatment and educational outcomes</a>.</p><h4 id="education-can-be-an-effective-instrument-to-reduce-violence"><a class="deep-link" href="#education-can-be-an-effective-instrument-to-reduce-violence"></a>Education can be an effective instrument to reduce violence</h4><p>The interaction between violence and education operates in both directions, which means education can be used as an instrument to reduce the prevalence of violence. In Uganda, for example, a programme that provided life skills and vocational training for girls who had been forced into sexual acts, led to substantially fewer of these girls being victims of sexual abuse &#x2013; an impact largely attributed to acquired skills (Bandiera et al. 2017).<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p><p>Similarly, parenting interventions that promote skills and knowledge among parents have shown positive effects on domestic violence. In Liberia, for example, a program that provided training in positive parenting and non-violent behavior reduced violent punishment drastically (Sim et al. 2014).<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></section>


















<section><h2 id="data-quality-and-measurement"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-and-measurement"></a>Data Quality and Measurement</h2><p>Most of the available cross-country data on violence against children comes from self-reported incidents and behavior in household surveys. This entails two important limitations. First, there is a tendency for self-reported violence to be biased. This is to be expected, since violence against children is often illegal, and even when it is not, it typically involves some of the most private aspects of everyday family life. Secondly, there are often comparability issues, since the survey instruments often change across time and countries.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the available data is still helpful to shed light on the rough order of magnitude of the problem. Much work needs to be done to improve data quality and availability on this topic. But what is currently available is already a good place to start.</p></section>
