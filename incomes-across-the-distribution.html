In the US incomes for the bottom half of the population were stagnating for most of the last 4 decades (with a notable exception over the second half of the 1990s). In the UK the first period resembles the experience of the US &#x2013; incomes at the bottom of the distribution were stagnating, incomes at the top were rising rapidly. But over the second period &#x2013; from 1991 onwards &#x2013; the trend in the UK has changed significantly: economic growth was shared equally across the distribution from the lowest to the highest decile.</p><p>The comparison also show that growth in the UK &#x2013; particularly for the lowest income group &#x2013; was much stronger than in the US. A comparison with other rich countries shows that the experience of the US &#x2013; strongly rising inequality and stagnation for a large part of the population &#x2013; is unique to the US. Other rich countries were much more successful in sharing the benefits of growth across the distribution.</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/income-growth-since-1974-US-and-UK-comparison.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7761" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/income-growth-since-1974-US-and-UK-comparison-750x550.png" alt="income-growth-since-1974-US-and-UK-comparison" width="750" height="550"></a></p><h3 id="the-uk-increasing-inequality-in-the-80s-followed-by-strong-growth-for-all-households"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-uk-increasing-inequality-in-the-80s-followed-by-strong-growth-for-all-households"></a>The UK &#x2013; increasing inequality in the 80s followed by strong growth for all households</h3><p>The following interactive chart offers a more detailed look at the evolution of incomes in the UK.</p><p>Inequality has evolved differently in different countries; it is not one story that would be the same everywhere. Inequality is determined by the complex interactions of the tax system, government policy, education, growth cycle and many other factors.</p><p>The UK experienced a large increase in inequality during the 80s but has since stabilized. The early 80s saw a period of rising inequality caused by stagnation of the middle and lower income groups and growth at the higher end. Uneven growth in the years leading up to 1991 meant further rises in inequality.&#xA0;Throughout the 90s and 00s, more even growth across the distribution has meant little change to&#xA0;inequality. In comparison with other countries it is worth pointing out that income growth in the UK was remarkably strong in the two decades leading up to the crisis.</p><h6>Income inequality and growth of living standards across the income distribution in the UK, 1974-2010&#xA0;&#x2013; Brian Nolan, Stefan Thewissen, and Max Roser</h6><p><iframe style="border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/LivingStandards_UK_LISdata/LivingStandards_UK_LISdata.html" width="100%" height="655" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><address><a class="fancybox-iframe" href="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/LivingStandards_UK_LISdata/LivingStandards_UK_LISdata.html">Full screen view</a> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/LivingStandards_UK_LISdata/LivingStandards_UK_LISdata.csv">Download Data</a></address><h3 id="the-us-incomes-for-most-households-stagnate-inequality-increases-constantly"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-us-incomes-for-most-households-stagnate-inequality-increases-constantly"></a>The US &#x2013; incomes for most households stagnate &amp; inequality increases constantly</h3><p>Inequality in the US has increased dramatically over time. During the 80s, we can see that the living standards of the poorest half fell while they increased for the richest. Throughout the 90s there was a sustained period of improvement at all levels of society, but without any real reduction in inequality. From the year 2000 onwards we observe a period of stagnation for the lower income groups accompanied by increased inequality as the richest capture most of the gains from growth. In 2013, approximately 60% of the population were better off in than the year 2000.</p><h6>Income inequality and growth of living standards across the income distribution in the USA, 1974-2013&#xA0;&#x2013; Brian Nolan, Stefan Thewissen, and Max Roser</h6><p><iframe style="border: 0px none;" src="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/LivingStandards_USA_LISdata/LivingStandards_USA_LISdata.html" width="100%" height="655" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><address><a class="fancybox-iframe" href="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/LivingStandards_USA_LISdata/LivingStandards_USA_LISdata.html">Full screen view</a> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/LivingStandards_USA_LISdata/LivingStandards_USA_LISdata.csv">Download Data</a></address><h3 id="australia-rising-inequality-but-everyone-is-better-off"><a class="deep-link" href="#australia-rising-inequality-but-everyone-is-better-off"></a>Australia &#x2013; rising inequality but everyone is better off</h3><p>Australia has also seen an increase in inequality, but in contrast to the US, the incomes of all households increased substantially. This contrast is a good example that makes clear that we cannot rely on aggregate measures &#x2013; like mean GDP growth and inequality measures &#x2013; alone.

The measure of disposable household income employed in the Luxembourg Income Study Database is paid employment and self-employment income, capital income, transfer income, which includes social security transfers (work-related insurance transfers, universal benefits, and assistance benefits) and private transfers, minus income taxes and social security contributions. This follows the definitions of the Canberra Group.</p><p>The income definition is visualized in the following Figure.</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Figure-2.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7727 size-large" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Figure-2-750x492.png" alt="Definition of household equivalent disposable income" width="750" height="492"></a></p><p>Market household income &#x2013; for which you find data in the dataset but not in this entry &#x2013; is defined as the sum of labour income (paid employment and self-employment income) and capital income.</p><h3 id="the-equivalence-scale"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-equivalence-scale"></a>The &#x2018;equivalence scale&#x2019;</h3><p>Two households on the same income but one comprising a single individual and another a couple with two children will have differing living standards, because a household with several individuals benefits from economies of scale in consumption. We include both equivalised and per capita decile information in the database. For per capita income, we calculate household income and divide it by the number of household members. For equivalised income, we assume economies of scale by applying the square root of the household size as the equivalence scale. Both per capita and equivalised income assume equal sharing of income across individuals within a household.</p><h3 id="data-on-cpi-and-deflators"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-on-cpi-and-deflators"></a>Data on CPI and deflators</h3><p>To use income levels to measure living standards, the income measures are corrected for changes in price levels over time and in purchasing power across countries. We use the consumer price index (CPI, from OECD Consumer Prices (MEI), all items) to deflate household income. To convert to a common currency we apply Purchasing Power Parities for actual individual consumption to household incomes sourced from OECD National Accounts. We express all PPP-adjusted figures in 2011 international dollars. We provide all incomes in both nominal terms and in inflation-adjusted 2011 international dollars in the full database that is directly available <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Thewissen-et-al.-2016-Incomes-across-the-distribution-database.xlsx">here</a>.</p><h3 id="gini-index"><a class="deep-link" href="#gini-index"></a>Gini index</h3><p>The gini index is the most commonly used inequality measure and is explained <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></section>
