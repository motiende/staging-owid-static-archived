Galwey &amp; E. Ortiz-Ospina</em></p><p>Correlation is a relationship between two variables. For example, the weight of human individuals is correlated with their height: a tall person usually, but not always, weighs more than a short person. The term correlation usually refers to a single number that reflects the strength of association between two numerical variables (e.g. human height and human weight, which can each be measured on a continuous numerical scale).</p><p>Relationships can also occur between categorical variables &#x2013; for example between gender and colour blindness, which is commoner in males than in females &#x2013; or between a categorical variable and a continuous variable &#x2013; for example between gender and height, males generally being taller than females. But relationships involving categorical variables are not usually referred to as correlations.</p><p>The strength of a correlation is measured by a number called the correlation coefficient, often represented by the letter <em>r</em>, on a scale from -1 to +1.  A correlation coefficient of +1 (i.e. r = 1) means a perfect positive relationship between the two variables: if you know the value of one, you can tell exactly what the value of the other will be.</p><p>Conversely, r = -1 means a perfect negative relationship between the variables.  If r = 0, this means that there is no simple relationship between the two variables: a high value of one does not tell you whether the value of the other will be high or low.</p><p>The chart below shows a fairly strong negative correlation (r =-0.8203) between the education of women in a country (average years of schooling of women in reproductive age) and the <a href="https://owid.cloud/fertility-rate">fertility rate</a> in that country (average live births per woman). This shows that countries where women in reproductive age tend to have more education, are also countries where women tend to have fewer children.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility?time=2010" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility?time=2010" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility-95fd69b9475fdff2ec4bb7d3b69eaf43_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>The correlation coefficient does not necessarily tell the whole story of the relationship between two variables. For example, the relationship between fertility rates and women&#x2019;s education in the chart above looks somewhat curved, and is therefore not well represented by a single number. In countries where female educational attainment is high, a given increase in female education is associated with a small decrease in fertility rates; whereas when female educational attainment is very low, the same increase is associated with a much larger decrease in observed fertility rates.</p><p>There are several other ways in which the correlation coefficient may not be fully adequate to summarise the relationship between two variables. We discuss these in a related glossary entry <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/glossary#what-s-the-difference-between-correlation-and-causation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">What&#x2019;s the difference between correlation and causation?</a></p><h3 id="what-s-the-difference-between-correlation-and-causation"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-s-the-difference-between-correlation-and-causation"></a>What&#x2019;s the <strong>difference between correlation and causation</strong>?</h3><p><em>Keywords: Causality, Correlation, Impact</em></p><p><em>Authors: N.W. Galwey &amp; E. Ortiz-Ospina</em></p><p>Correlation is a relationship between two variables.  For example, the weight of human individuals is correlated with their height: a tall person usually, but not always, weighs more than a short person. The correlation between two variables does not depend on the units of measurement of the variables, and it doesn&#x2019;t tell us anything about the direction or source of the relationship. A causal relationship, on the other hand, is a specific type of directed cause-and-effect association between two variables. Correlation doesn&apos;t imply causation, nor does causation imply correlation.</p><p>The chart below shows the relationship between the education of women in a country (average years of schooling of women in reproductive age) and the <a href="https://owid.cloud/fertility-rate">fertility rate</a> in that country (average live births per woman). This shows a strong negative correlation.  However, this correlation may occur because educational attainment causes changes in the number of children that women choose to have, or because having children causes changes in educational attainment. In fact, it may also be that neither variable directly influences the other, but that both are responding to some other, perhaps unobserved, variable: for example, countries where women tend to have higher educational attainment may also be countries where female labor force participation is higher, and it may be this factor that is causing differences in reproductive outcomes. To decide which explanation is more reasonable, we must have other information. (As it turns out, the available evidence suggests education does contribute to explain fertility, and you can read more about it <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/fertility-rate#what-explains-the-change-in-the-number-of-children-women-have" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility?time=2010" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility?time=2010" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility-95fd69b9475fdff2ec4bb7d3b69eaf43_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>If we have information on a third variable for each observation, we can ask how strong is the correlation between the first two variables after adjusting for the third. For example, in the case of education and fertility, employment and female labor force participation rates across countries are also available, so we can find the correlation coefficient between fertility rates and educational attainment after controlling for differences in female employment across countries. This is called the <em>partial correlation coefficient</em>, and we can think of it as the correlation coefficient that would have been observed if all countries had the same level of female labour force participation. It takes us one step further to understand the interaction between the variables.</p><p>However, a partial correlation is still not sufficient to identify a causal relationship. First, the direction of the relationship is undetermined (is x causing y or is y causing x?). And second, there are always unobservable factors that may be unaccounted for. Correlation doesn&#x2019;t imply causation.</p><p>Interestingly, it is also true that causation does not imply correlation. Indeed, an absence of correlation between two variables does not necessarily indicate that they are independent. For example, consider the height of an arrow at different moments in time after it is shot vertically from a bow.  There is an exact relationship between the time and the height: if you know the time in seconds since the arrow was shot, you can tell exactly how high the arrow will be. However, time and height are uncorrelated &#x2013; on average, over the whole range of time while the arrow is in the air, a later time is not associated with a greater or lesser height.</p><p>Correlations are informative. But there are many ways in which a correlation coefficient can conceal as much as it reveals &#x2013; a collection of examples is presented <a href="https://janhove.github.io/teaching/2016/11/21/what-correlations-look-like" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-linear-regression"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-a-linear-regression"></a>What is a <strong>linear regression</strong>?</h3><p><em>Keywords: Correlation,  Linear correlation, Regression analysis, Regression coefficient</em></p><p><em>Authors: N.W. Galwey &amp; E. Ortiz-Ospina</em></p><p>In statistics, a regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between two or more variables. In its simplest form, regressing two variables requires finding a line of best fit to describe the relationship between them.</p><p>To provide the intuition behind this concept, let us consider first the related concept of <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/glossary#what-is-correlation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">correlation</a>. Correlation is a relationship between two variables.  For example, the weight of human individuals is correlated with their height: a tall person usually, but not always, weighs more than a short person. The correlation between two variables does not depend on the direction of the relationship between them. However, the related statistical concept of &#x2018;regression&#x2019; captures both the strength and direction of the relationship.</p><p>In regression analysis, the direction of the relationship between the variables comes from treating one of them as the &#x2018;response&#x2019; variable (or the &#x2018;dependent&#x2019; variable), and the other as the &#x2018;explanatory&#x2019; (or &#x2018;independent&#x2019;) variable.</p><p>For example, a regression analysis can be performed to relate the education of women in a country (the explanatory variable) and the fertility rate in that country (the response variable); as show in the chart below. Loosely speaking, regressing fertility on education requires &#x2018;finding the line of best fit&#x2019;, which essentially means drawing a straight line in a way that ensures the points in the scatter plot are as close as possible to the drawn line.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility-regression-line" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility-regression-line" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/womens-educational-attainment-vs-fertility-regression-line_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>The line of best fit is often used to make predictions. In this example, the line could be used as a model, where the slope of the line (the &#x2018;regression coefficient&#x2019;) tells us the change in number of children per woman that would be associated with every additional year of schooling.</p><p>Two important points are worth emphasising. First, the order and unit of measurement of the variables matters: if education is measured differently, or if it is used as the response variable, then the regression coefficient will be different. And second, the fact that the model allows making predictions doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that those predictions are good.</p><p>Indeed, regression coefficients can be expressed in terms of <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/glossary#what-is-correlation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">correlation coefficients</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression#Fitting_the_regression_line" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> is the mathematical derivation). And since <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/glossary#what-s-the-difference-between-correlation-and-causation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">correlation does not imply causation</a>, it is often the case that a simple regression model is not, on its own, a good instrument to make predictions.</p><p>&#x2013; &apos;Seeing Theory&apos; is a beautiful free online textbook on statistics that includes a <a href="http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/index.html#secondPage/chapter6">chapter on regression analysis</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-confidence-interval"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-a-confidence-interval"></a>What is a <strong>confidence interval</strong>?</h3><p><em>Keywords: Confidence interval, Selection bias</em></p><p><em>Authors: N.W. Galwey &amp; E. Ortiz-Ospina</em></p><p>When we want to understand the relationship between variables, we typically attempt to estimate it using data from a sample.  A &#x2018;confidence interval&#x2019; is a statistical method that gives us an indication of just how accurate our sample estimate is.</p><p>For example, the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/glossary#what-is-correlation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">correlation coefficient</a> between weight and height, calculated from a sample of schoolchildren in a specific city, can be used as an estimate of the correlation in the whole population of schoolchildren in the country.  If the school we choose to estimate this correlation is large and typical for the country, then we would expect this estimate to be close, but not exactly the same as the correlation in the whole population. Setting a &#x2018;confidence interval&#x2019; involves using information about the dispersion of the data, in order to set lower and upper bounds on our estimate, so that we have an idea of how close the sample and population estimates are: in this example, how close the school-level estimate is to the general country-level relationship.</p><p>Confidence intervals can be constructed for any type of statistical estimate. The chart below, for example, shows the estimated average impact of organic farming, relative to conventional farming, on a number of dimensions (from <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/is-organic-agriculture-better-for-the-environment">this post</a>). These estimates come from averaging  impacts across studies in different settings. Here, if a dot is very close to &#x2018;1&#x2019;, then it means that organic and conventional farming tend to have on average a similar impact on that specific dimension. The &#x2018;whiskers&#x2019; below and above the dots, are the confidence interval. These whiskers give us an idea of how accurate the estimates of the impacts are.</p><p>Consider the purple dot and whiskers under the block labelled &#x2018;Greenhouse gas emissions&#x2019;. Since the whiskers cross the horizontal line at &#x2018;1&#x2019;, it means that based on the sample of studies considered, we can&#x2019;t rule out that organic and conventional farming have a similar impacts on emissions in general. (This is why on this chart, the whiskers are grayed out whenever they do not cross &#x2018;1&#x2019;).</p><p><a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-750x543.png" alt="Organic vs. conventional impacts final 01" width="750" height="543" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14014" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-150x109.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-400x289.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-750x543.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01-768x556.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Organic-vs.-Conventional-Impacts-FINAL-01.png 6304w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p>An important caveat is that confidence intervals require making assumptions about how the sample relates to the population. In its simplest form, confidence intervals assume that a sample is a random subset of the population. In many social situations, this assumption is violated by &apos;selection bias&apos;.</p><p>Selection bias arises from the method of collecting data. For example, if you measure an outcome of interest for patients who self-select into a medical study, you will likely have a biased sample, because those who self-selected are often different from those who do not sign up for the study, and may therefore not be representative of the overall population intended to be analyzed.</p><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Wikipedia entry on selection bias</a> you find more examples and technical explanations.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-statistical-significance-test"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-a-statistical-significance-test"></a>What is a statistical <strong>significance test</strong>?</h3><p><em>Keywords: Statistical significance test, Statistical hypothesis testing, p-value.</em></p><p><em>Authors: N.W. Galwey &amp; E. Ortiz-Ospina</em></p><p>We are often interested in knowing whether there is clear evidence of a particular relationship between two variables. For example, how strong is the evidence against the hypothesis that two variables are uncorrelated?  We can ask this question by performing a &#x2018;significance test&#x2019;. When we perform such a test, a statistical metric called the &#x2018;p-value&#x2019; helps us interpret the result.</p><p>When we want to understand the relationship between variables, we typically attempt to estimate these relationships using data from a sample.  For example, the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/glossary#what-is-correlation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">correlation coefficient</a> between weight and height, calculated from a sample of schoolchildren in a specific city, can be used as an estimate of the correlation in the whole population of schoolchildren in the country.  If the school from which we select the children to estimate this correlation is a large and typical school for the country, then we would expect this estimate to be close, but not exactly the same as the correlation in the whole population of chilren.</p><p>A significance test may be one-sided or two-sided, depending on whether we have a prior expectation concerning the direction of any relationship between the variables. For example, it is appropriate to perform a one-sided test of the correlation between the weight and height of schoolchildren, because we expect that if there is a true relationship between these variables it will be positive.</p><p>The probability that an estimated correlation could occur by chance if there were no real relationship (i.e. if r = 0) is indicated by the so-called &#x2018;p-value&#x2019; from such a test. This is a probability value between 0 and 1, a small p-value is interpreted as significant evidence of a real relationship.</p><p>p-values can be obtained for any hypothesis test involving statistical estimates. For example, we could run an experiment where we test whether a particular intervention (e.g. cash transfers for the <a href="https://owid.cloud/extreme-poverty/">poor</a>) has an impact on an outcome of interest (e.g. work). We would estimate the impact for a representative sample of individuals, and then we would run a statistical significance test to assess a hypothesis (e.g. <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/extreme-poverty#giving-people-money-conditional-cash-transfers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how likely is it that cash transfers have no discouraging effect on work?</a>).</p><p>A small p-value would tell us that we have strong evidence to reject the hypothesis (e.g. reject the baseline conjecture that cash transfers have no effect on work). And conversely, a large p-value would tell us that we cannot reject the hypothesis. Crucially, however, it should be kept in mind that failure to reject a hypothesis is not the same as decisively accepting it. Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005" rel="noopener" target="_blank">article in Vox</a> explains it as follows.<br>
</p><blockquote> Rejecting the null [hypothesis] is like the &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; principle in court cases [...] In court, you start off with the assumption that the defendant is innocent. Then you start looking at the evidence: the bloody knife with his fingerprints on it, his history of violence, eyewitness accounts. As the evidence mounts, that presumption of innocence starts to look naive. At a certain point, jurors get the feeling, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is not innocent.</blockquote><p>Interpreting p-values also requires caution for other reasons. First, how &#x2018;small&#x2019; is a &#x2018;small p-value&#x2019; is a non-trivial question. In most academic studies, p-values below 0.05 are considered small, but this is the subject of <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking?utm_content=buffer27786&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_term=.lkylqOOMM#.ow2WnRRBB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much debate</a>.

It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. For a given person, the shortfall from the poverty line corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line.</p><p>The poverty gap index is calculated in several steps. First, it is necessary to calculate, household by household, the income or consumption shortfall from the poverty line. Then, to produce aggregate statistics, the sum of all such shortfalls across the entire population in a country (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall) is expressed in per capita terms &#x2013; this gives the mean shortfall from the poverty line. Finally, the mean shortfall from the poverty line is divided by the value of the poverty line.</p><p>The poverty gap index is often used in policy discussions because it has an intuitive unit (per cent mean shortfall) that allows for meaningful comparisons regarding the relative intensity of poverty.</p><p>For more information, data and analysis on the poverty gap index check our entry on <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/extreme-poverty/" target="_blank">Global Extreme Poverty</a></p><h3 id="what-are-poverty-traps"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-are-poverty-traps"></a>What are <strong>Poverty Traps</strong>?</h3><p>Economists use the term &apos;poverty trap&apos; to denote a situation in which individuals are stuck in deprivation over long periods of time, and there is nothing they can do by themselves to escape such situation. The term captures a situation in which poverty today causes poverty in the future, so households that start poor, remain poor.</p><p>Insufficient nutrition, for example, can lead to a poverty trap. More precisely, if physical capacity to work increases nonlinearly with food intake at low levels (i.e. if the first calories that we consume are used by our body to survive, rather than to provide the strength required to work), it is possible that those in extreme poverty get stuck in a perverse equilibrium characterized by low incomes and low nutrition: poor nutrition then becomes both the cause and consequence of poor incomes.</p><p>Conceptually, poverty traps can also take place at a collective &apos;macro&apos; level. For example, low-income countries may lack good growth fundamentals (e.g. technology, education and infrastructure, etc.) in order to support high saving rates leading to productivity gains that would be necessary to raise national incomes.</p><p>The concept of poverty traps is important in the context of policy, since it implies that one-off policy efforts that make it possible to &apos;escape the trap&apos; have permanent positive effects. This is the rationale often used to argue for &apos;big push&apos; macro policies &#x2013; such as the expansion of micro-finance in low-income countries. They are meant to trigger a virtuous circle betwen more savings, more investment and economic growth.</p><p>For more information, data and analysis on poverty traps check our entry on <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/extreme-poverty/" target="_blank">Global Extreme Poverty</a></p><h3 id="what-is-relative-poverty"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-relative-poverty"></a>What is <strong>Relative Poverty</strong>?</h3><p>People are considered to live in &#x2018;relative poverty&#x2019; if their living conditions are below those of a particular group of people at a particular point in time.

</div><footer class="article-footer"><h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3><ol class="footnotes"><li id="note-1"><p>There are two key indicators to measure poverty and social exclusion in Europe. The first one is based on the headcount of population “at-risk-of-poverty”. This corresponds to people living in households with incomes below 60% of the national median equivalised disposable income.  The ‘equivalised disposable income’ refers to income after applying equivalence factors to adjust for household composition, and after taking into account social transfers and taxes.</p>
<p>The other key indicator relates to ‘material deprivation’, and measures whether households can tick certain boxes, such as having certain goods (e.g. a washing machine, a TV, etc) or living in healthy environments (e.g. absence of pollution, noise, etc.)</p>
<p>In the 'Europe 2020 strategy', one of the key objectives is to reduce poverty by lifting at least 20 million people out of "the risk of poverty or social exclusion". Here, "People at risk of poverty or social exclusion" are those in at least one of the following three conditions: "at-risk-of-poverty after social transfers, severely materially deprived or living in a household with very low work intensity."</p>
