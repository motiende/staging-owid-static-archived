<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical View</h2><h3 id="historical-perspective"><a class="deep-link" href="#historical-perspective"></a>Historical perspective</h3><p>Historical studies suggest that child work was widespread in Europe and North America in the 19th century, but declined very rapidly at the turn of the 20th century. The available historical evidence seems consistent with the fact that industrialisation in western countries initially increased the demand for child labour, but then eventually contributed towards its elimination (see Cunningham, H., &amp; Viazzo, P. P. (1996) <a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> and the references therein). The following three visualizations show the share of children in employment for Italy, the UK and the United States at the turn of the 20th century century. Series data on rural versus urban child labour trends for the United States can also be added in third chart below; for both boys and girls, the incidence of child labour was higher in rural populations.</p><p>As we see, the incidence of child labour in Italy appeared to be higher than that of the UK and US, with slower rates of decline. By 1930, the incidence of child labour is estimated to be below 5%; this level was not reached in Italy until around 30 years later, in 1960.</p><p>Whilst consistent survey data on child labour in the UK is limited beyond 1911, some estimates of 20th century labour have emerged. These statistics show the significant impact of the First and Second World Wars on childhood employment. Following a reported spike in employment during the First World War (1914-1918), rates of childhood labour appeared to fall to approximately 6-7 per cent of children aged 12-14 in England and Wales.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> This would make the UK&apos;s rate of reduction in child labour slightly faster than that of the United States. However, with the onset of the Second World War in 1939, the incidence of child employment appeared to show another spike- by 1944, this had increased again to 15.3 per cent of 12-14 year olds.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-italy" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-italy" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/incidence-of-child-labour-in-italy_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-the-uk" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-the-uk" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/incidence-of-child-labour-in-the-uk_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-the-united-states-1890-1930" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-the-united-states-1890-1930" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/incidence-of-child-labour-in-the-united-states-1890-1930_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>How do the child labour figures above compare to current global estimates? The following visualization plots the series for England, the US and Italy, together with two recent global series. The different series in this chart are not perfectly comparable because of differences in the definitions. However, they do provide a rough sense of perspective. As we can see, the incidence of child labour in England in 1900 was similar to global incidence a century later. Global rates of child labour today are similar to those of Italy in the 1950&apos;s at around 10 per cent.

The age bracket ranging from 5 to 17 years of age is common in many UN reports, but there is evidently a need to differentiate work at different ages, since children in their teenage years are less vulnerable to workplace abuse. Other common age brackets are 5-11 and 5-14 years of age.</p><p>The visualization below presents global trends, using estimates in two age brackets: 5-14 and 15-17 years of age. The source of the data is the same as above (ILO&#x2019;s report Marking Progress Against Child Labour 2013). Unfortunately these global estimates are not broken down by gender, and are not available for other age brackets. However, the pattern is consistent with the remark made above: child labour has been going down in recent years.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-incidence-of-child-labour-by-age-groups" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-incidence-of-child-labour-by-age-groups" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/global-incidence-of-child-labour-by-age-groups_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="the-share-of-economically-active-children-in-the-world-has-been-going-down-for-decades"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-share-of-economically-active-children-in-the-world-has-been-going-down-for-decades"></a>The share of economically active children in the world has been going down for decades</h4><p>The ILO Programme on Estimates and Projections of the Economically Active Population (EPEAP) has been producing statistics on labour force participation (for adults and children) since 1950, through the ILO&apos;s cross-country database known as LABORSTA. Basu (1999)<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> uses this source to produce global labour force participation rates for children (ages 10-14) in the period 1950-1995.</p><p>The following visualization presents the corresponding trend using the data published in Basu (1999). While these estimates are informative about child labour, they cannot be linked directly to those of children in employment published by the ILO IPEC for the period 2000-2012 due to issues of comparability; specifically, the IPEC and EPEAP estimates discussed above rely on different survey instruments covering a different set of countries, and break up the relevant population in different age brackets.</p><p>Many studies rely on the LABORSTA data to shed light on the extent of child labour in the 20th century. However, this source is generally believed to understate the extent of child labour, since data is not collected for work inside the household (not even market work). Nonetheless, regardless of discrepancies between these two sources, the trends tell a consistent story: the share of economically active children in the world has been going down for decades.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-incidence-of-child-labour" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-incidence-of-child-labour" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/global-incidence-of-child-labour_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="where-do-children-work"><a class="deep-link" href="#where-do-children-work"></a>Where do children work?</h4><p>Contrary to popular perception, most working children in the world are unpaid family workers, rather than paid workers in manufacturing establishments or other forms of wage employment.

Because of this it is informative to study child labour specifically when it is coupled with absence from school.</p><p>The following visualization shows the share of children in employment who work only (i.e. those children who are economically active <em>and</em> do not attend school). Again, there is wide variation across countries; while in Latin America the majority of children who are economically active also attend school, in sub-Saharan Africa this is not the case. However, trends are encouraging on the whole, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where the problem is most acute.

<section><h2 id="correlates-determinants-consequences"><a class="deep-link" href="#correlates-determinants-consequences"></a>Correlates, Determinants, &amp; Consequences</h2><p>This section discusses the relationship between children&apos;s work and two crucial&#xA0;variables: schooling and income. Low school attendance&#xA0;is typically considered one of the most important consequences of child labour, while low household&#xA0;income is&#xA0;considered an important&#xA0;determinant. See Schultz and Strauss (2008) for a discussion of academic evidence informing other potential determinants and consequences.</p><h3 id="child-labour-and-schooling"><a class="deep-link" href="#child-labour-and-schooling"></a>Child labour and schooling</h3><p>As it has already been mentioned, child labour is particularly problematic to the extent that it hinders the children&apos;s development, notably by interfering with schooling. Since time is a scarce resource, the extent to which children&apos;s employment is linked to school attendance depends on the type and number of hours worked.</p><p>The following visualization taken from Schultz and Strauss (2008) presents evidence of this link using data from UNICEF&#x2019;s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2000 and 2001); it plots school attendance rates for children 10&#x2013;14 against total hours worked in the last week (by type of work) with 95 percent confidence intervals (labeled CI and plotted in lighter shades).</p><p>The steepest part of the pictured curves are in the range 20-45 hours, suggesting&#x2014;as one would naturally expect&#x2014;that it is most difficult for a child to attend school when approaching&#xA0;full-time work. This evidence also shows that there are no significant difference by domestic or marketed work.</p><p>This chart shows the relationship between school attendance and hours worked using micro data (i.e. the authors plot the relationship by pooling observations across individual households). A similar pattern can also be seen in the data if we look at aggregates: In countries where children tend to work longer hours, it is more common that working children remain out of school. <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/working-children-out-of-school-ages-7-14-vs-hours-worked-by-children-ages-7-14">This interactive chart shows this</a> by plotting country-level average hours worked by children against share of working children who are out of school.</p><h6>School Attendance vs. Hours Worked - Schultz and Strauss (2008) <a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a>

(2003)<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a>; Gunnarsson, V., Orazem, P., Sanchez, M. (2006)<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a>)While these studies can be criticized on the grounds of the validity of the instrumental variables used, they seem to agree on the fact that there is a stronger association between child labour and schooling than the raw data would suggest.</p><h3 id="child-labour-and-income"><a class="deep-link" href="#child-labour-and-income"></a>Child labour and&#xA0;income</h3><p>Cross-country data on child labour and economic growth suggests a strong negative correlation between economic status and child labour. The following visualization depicts the cross-country incidence of child labour (share of children ages 7-14 involved in economic activity) against GDP per capita (PPP adjusted GDP per capita in international dollars). To provide some context regarding the absolute number of children, each country&apos;s observation is pictured as a circle where the size of the circle represents population aged 5-14.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/incidence-of-child-labour-vs-gdp-per-capita_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>This evidence cannot be interpreted causally; as before, countries differ in many aspects that may be associated with child labour choices and income. But there are a number of reasons why, conceptually, child labour might be indeed <em>caused</em> by poor living conditions. For example, children might only work if the parents are unable to meet subsistence conditions; or it could be the case that parents allocate more of the children&apos;s time to schooling as they afford the necessary inputs for schooling (text-books, uniforms, etc).</p><p>Partly following this logic, several countries have implemented cash transfer programmes in an attempt to discourage child labour and increase schooling. The idea behind these programmes is that the cash transfers are conditioned on a number of&#xA0;desirable actions, including sending children to school; and in doing so,&#xA0;they lower the relative costs of schooling and raise family income. &#xA0;Schultz (2004)<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> evaluates one such program in Mexico&#xA0;(the so-called &apos;Progresa&apos; program) and &#xA0;finds a significant reduction in wage and market work associated with eligibility for Progresa. Similar findings have been found in other countries as well. The literature often refers to these programmes as the prime example of &quot;collaborative measures&quot; against child labour: non-coercive interventions that alter the economic environment of decision makers in order to make them more willing to let children stay out of work.</p></section>

The ILO&#x2019;s Convention No. 138, adopted in 1973 and ratified by most countries of the world, stipulates the relevant ages that different countries use to define child labour.</p><h4 id="hours-worked-and-age-classification"><a class="deep-link" href="#hours-worked-and-age-classification"></a>Hours worked and age classification</h4><p>According to the definition provided above, whether or not a given job is considered &apos;child labour&apos; depends on the details of the actual context &#x2014; the child&#x2019;s age, the number of hours worked and the type of tasks performed.

(2013)<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a>).</p><p>Global aggregates and cross-country data are not publicly available for &apos;children in child labour&apos; as per the conceptual definition above. The ILO tends to report figures of economically active children for the broadest age bracket (5-17 years of age). The World Bank &#x2013; World Development Indicators also report figures of economically active children, but use a narrower age definition (7-14 years of age). In both cases, &apos;economically active&apos; refers to children who work for at least one hour during a reference week.</p><p>Because of the limitations of the data, academic studies often focus on children&#x2019;s time allocation, which leaves more room for exploring the consequences of employment on other activities, such as school attendance. These studies tend to rely on country-specific survey data.</p><h4 id="terminology"><a class="deep-link" href="#terminology"></a>Terminology</h4><p>Many studies distinguish between &apos;children in child labour&apos; and &apos;children in employment&apos;, while using the terms &apos;working children&apos;, &apos;children in economic activity&apos; and &apos;children in employment&apos; interchangeably. In such cases, the former (&apos;children in child labour&apos;) are considered a subset of the latter (&apos;children in employment&apos; or any of the aforementioned interchangeable terms). As noted above, children in child labour include those in <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/WorstFormsofChildLabour/lang--en/index.htm worst forms of child labour "> worst forms of child labour</a> and children in employment below the minimum age, excluding children in permissible light work&#x2014;where &quot;permissible light work&quot; is defined as any non-hazardous work by children (ages 12 to 14) of less than 14 hours during the reference week (for more details see ILO-IPEC, Diallo, Y., et al. (2013)<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a>).</p><h3 id="data-quality"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality"></a>Data quality</h3><p>Schultz and Strauss (2008) provide a complete account of the particular challenges that arise from measuring children employment through household surveys. The authors highlight difficulties arising from coverage (i.e. capturing the most vulnerable children through random sampling) and accuracy (i.e. misreported hours worked and sensitivity to the recall period used).</p><p>Cunningham and Viazzo (1996) and Humphries (2010)<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> note similar challenges in the use of national census and household survey data for accurate coverage of the incidence of child labour. There remains a generally accepted consensus that census data is likely to underestimate the scale of child labour for several reasons. This is particuarly important in case of later censuses, where national regulation required children to be in education; in this case, child labour was likely to be underreported, for fear of prosecution. These estimates therefore often underrepresent the numerous children, particularly girls, who worked unpaid at home. Since census results typically capture data from households, this often limits coverage to children who live within a family household. This can exclude children either orphaned, or living on the streets- in many cases, we might expect the incidence of child labour to be more prevalent in these demographics.</p><p>Specifically regarding the information published by the World Bank in their World Development Indicators, it is important to highlight that, while definitions are standardized (children in employment are always defined as those children aged 7-14 involved in economic activity for at least one hour in the reference week of the corresponding survey), the data-collection instruments are not standardized across the different sub-sources feeding the consolidated dataset. It is because of this that many policy reports (such as the much-referenced report <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf"> Marking Progress Against Child Labour (2013) </a>) &apos;homogenize&apos; the data before reporting estimates, by correcting for discrepancies in the underlying survey instruments. Those visualizations presented here that use the consolidated data published by the World Bank have not been corrected.</p><p>Issues of consistency across different survey instruments in the World Bank consolidated data can help us explain country-specific patterns that are otherwise difficult to interpret. Consider the case of India. As it can be appreciated in the following visualization, the incidence of child labour in India seems to jump up in 2006, only to go back in 2010 to the levels that would have been predicted with the observations from 2000 and 2005. After checking the <a href="http://www.ucw-project.org/survey-catalogue.aspx"> survey catalogue</a>, it becomes clear that the estimates for 2006 come from the country&apos;s Demographic and Health Survey, while those for the other years come from consecutive rounds of the National Sample Survey. Cases such as this illustrate why current academic studies typically rely on data stemming from a single survey instrument, such as UNICEF&apos;s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-india" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/incidence-of-child-labour-in-india" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/incidence-of-child-labour-in-india_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="data-and-research-gaps"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-and-research-gaps"></a>Data and research gaps</h3><p>In addition to the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/child-labor/#data-quality">above-mentioned</a> difficulties related to measurement, there are also important limitations in the way child labour data is made available.</p><p>As pointed out <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/child-labor/#hours-worked-and-age-classification">before</a>, most UN reports publish global child labour estimates for custom age brackets, and only sometimes break down estimates by gender and type of work (including distinctions for &#x2018;light work&#x2019;, &#x2018;hazardous work&#x2019;, etc.). To our knowledge, there are no publicly available cross-country estimates of the evolution of child labour, broken down simultaneously by gender, age and type of work.</p><p>This is unfortunate, since a set of time-series constructed from &apos;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contingency tables</a>&apos; cutting across age, gender and type of work would give us a much better picture of where to focus our efforts to fight child labour. Constructing such tables should be straightforward from the depurated micro-data used to produce the existing global reports.</p><p>Relatedly, it would be similarly helpful if the depurated cross-country series published in the World Bank &#x2013; World Development Indicators were expanded to account for more flexible definitions of economic activity beyond &quot;one hour of work in the reference week&quot;.</p><p>Some exercises along these lines have already been undertaken in academia. As we discuss <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/child-labor/#child-labour-and-schooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">above</a>, Schultz and Strauss (2008) present estimates of &#x2018;children in economic activity&#x2019;, by type of activity (market work and domestic work) and by number of hours worked. To do this, the authors used mainly UNICEF&#x2019;s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) from 2000 and 2001. It would be extremely helpful for researchers and policymakers if such exercises were updated and published regularly in open-access data portals.</p><p>Regarding gaps in empirical research, it is important to highlight the lack of robust evidence speaking to the consequences of child labour on future outcomes &#x2013; such as the working children&#x2019;s subsequent health and earnings in adulthood. Schultz and Strauss (2008) provide a summary of available evidence on this research front. The body of literature is thin and the econometric results tend to be fragile because of difficulties to establish causality.</p><p>A related research question for which there is little robust empirical evidence is whether child labor is the result of &#x2018;agency problems&#x2019; &#x2013; namely, whether children work <em>because</em> parents fail to fully consider the tradeoffs and costs that work has on their children.</p></section>

They include a child labour module which asks children 5&#x2013;14 whether they work outside of their household in the last week and the last year as well as how many hours they worked outside the household in the last week. The surveys also collect hours in the last week for work in domestic chores and in the household business.</p><ul>
