data for the year 2017.</div><p>Every sixth death in the world is due to cancer, making it the second leading cause of death (second only to&#xA0;cardiovascular diseases).<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 2017, 9.6 million people are estimated to have died from the various forms of cancer. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) put relatively small error margins around this global figure: the lower and upper estimates extend from 9.2 to 9.7 million.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>Progress against many other causes of deaths and demographic drivers of increasing <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth#shares-by-world-regions">population size</a>, <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy">life expectancy</a> and&#xA0;&#x2014; particularly in higher-income countries&#xA0;&#x2014; aging populations mean that the total number of cancer deaths continues to increase. This is a very personal topic to many: nearly everyone knows or has lost someone dear to them from this collection of diseases.</p><p>Cancers are defined by the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Cancer Institute (NCI)</a> as a collection of diseases in which abnormal cells can divide and spread to nearby tissue. As this definition suggests, cancers can arise in many parts of the body (leading to a range of cancer types, as shown below) and in some cases spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems.</p></section>



<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical View</h2><h3 id="global-perspective-on-cancer-prevalence"><a class="deep-link" href="#global-perspective-on-cancer-prevalence"></a>Global perspective on cancer prevalence</h3><p>What is the prevalence of cancers across the world&apos;s population? The charts below provide data on the share of a given population with any form of cancer. This is first shown collectively across all cancer types, followed by breakdown by cancer type. Overall, we tend to see a higher prevalence of cancers in higher-income countries - strongly attributed to the increased risk of cancer from particular lifestyle factors such as smoking, diet and obesity, and alcohol intake. Prevalence of cancer ranges from approximately 5.5 percent of the population, down to around 0.4 percent.</p><p>When broken down by cancer type we see that globally breast cancer is the most prevalent form, followed by prostrate and colon &amp; rectum cancer. Across most countries these are the top three cancer forms, however they tend to vary in their ranking across the world.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-population-with-cancer" class="grapherPreview">

But is this really the case?</p><p>Whilst a crucial metric of total disease burden and mortality, the absolute number of deaths has two key caveats: it fails to account for changes in population size and age structure. As we have explored above, the majority of cancer deaths occur in those aged over 50 years old; this means we should expect the total number of cancer deaths to increase as a population ages. The drivers of rising <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy">life expectancy</a>, aging populations, and <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth#shares-by-world-regions">population growth</a> can compound to give a skewed perception of frequency.</p><p>A more useful metric in this regard is the age-standardized death rate. This metric corrects for the effects of changing age distributions by normalising to a fixed reference population structure (assumed the same across countries and with time), and for differences in population size by reporting as the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> The age-standardized death rate from all cancer types are shown in the visualisation below. This data can be explored through time using the &apos;play&apos; button at the bottom of the chart, and national time-series can be viewed by clicking on a respective country.</p><p>In 2017, we see that most countries have death rates of 50 to 150 deaths per 100,000 individuals. On average, higher-income countries tend to fall towards the upper band of this range; across North America, Europe, and Australasia, rates are typically close to 150 per 100,000. This is also true across a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rates across Latin America, Asia, and some parts of Africa are on average lower (50-125 per 100,000).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/cancer-death-rates-per-100000?tab=map" class="grapherPreview">

                </figure><p>The number of cancer deaths can therefore be influenced by three key factors: an actual change in the prevalence of cancer, changes in population size, and changes in population age (since we see <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-age">higher cancer death rates</a> in older individuals within a given population). In the chart below we show an index of three variables since 1990: the total number of cancer deaths (this does not correct for population size or age); all ages death rate (which corrects for population size); and age-standardized death rate (which corrects for population size and aging). These trends are indexed to the year 1990, where all values in 1990 are equal to 100 (a value of 120, for example, would indicate a 20 percent increase since 1990; 60 would indicate a 40 percent reduction).</p><p>At a global level we see that total cancer deaths have increased more than 50 percent since 1990. However, when we correct for population size (all ages death rate), this increase is much smaller at just over 10 percent. Finally, once corrected for age, we see rates have actually fallen by 15-20 percent since 1990. In other words, the individual incidence of cancer deaths has actually fallen. These indexed trends are available to view by country in the chart below using the &quot;Change country&quot; option.</p><p>The overall global trend nonetheless shows an often counter-intuitive finding: despite increasing numbers of cancer deaths, individual death rates are falling.

This is predominantly a result of aging (and growing) populations. Once we correct the number of deaths for population size, we see that cancer death rates have approximately flatlined; then when further corrected for age we see that globally, death rates are falling. This represents progress, although very slow.</p><p>Death rates have the limitation of being unable to account for the burden of disease from illness or disability - they therefore capture only mortality, and not morbidity. Another metric used to measure disease burden is Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). DALYs are used to measure total burden of disease - both from years of life lost and years lived with a disability. One DALY equals one lost year of healthy life.</p><p>The chart below shows age-standardized rates of DALYs from cancers, measured per 100,000 individuals. This is measured across all cancer types. Also shown are disease burden rates broken down by cancer types. We see that at a global level, the largest burden results from tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer, followed by liver, stomach, colon &amp; rectum, and breast cancer.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/disease-burden-rates-from-cancers" class="grapherPreview">

In the United States, this rate peaked in the 1980s in men (and not until the early 2000s for women). In the UK this peak was earlier in men (1970s), but similar in Italy (1980s). These trends are most tightly correlated to the increase, then reduction in smoking rates through governmental and health policies.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/cancer-death-rates-in-the-us" class="grapherPreview">

This is partly attributed to earlier detection, and improved treatment: both of these factors have contributed to a significant increase in cancer survival rates across the world.</p><p>In the visual below we see the change in five-year survival rates (that is, the share of those diagnosed with cancer who survive at least five years following diagnosis) from the 1970s (1970-77) to 2007-2013 (this is the latest data available given the need for a five-year period). Overall we see that survival rates from all cancers have increased from 50 to 67 percent. This results from the combination of both early detection and improved treatment.</p><p>This change, however, varies significantly by cancer type. Progress in some has been very large: survival rates from prostate cancer, for example, have increased from 68 to almost 99 percent over this period. At the other end of the scale, five-year survival rates of uterus and cervix uteri cancers have actually declined since the 1970s. We still see major differences in survival rates overall: some, such as prostate and thyroid have a 98-99 percent five-year survival rate; those at the bottom of the spectrum (pancreas, liver, lung, &amp; esophagus) have less than 20 percent probability.</p><p><a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17617" src="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01.png" alt="Five year cancer survival rates usa v2 01" width="13114" height="9613" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-150x110.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-400x293.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-750x550.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01-768x563.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Five-year-cancer-survival-rates-USA-v2-01.png 13114w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p>The US National Cancer Institute also published data on five-year survival rates by sex and race. This data is available in the charts below. Overall we see similar trends, with prostate, thyroid, skin and breast cancer have the highest survival rates, and pancreas, liver, lung and esophagus the lowest. It is also the case that survival rates with black demographics (both for males and females) tend to be lower on average than that of white individuals. </p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/five-year-cancer-survival-in-usa" class="grapherPreview">

The relative contribution of genetic factors (DNA replication and tissue type) versus external exposure has been a dominant topic within cancer research. The outcomes of such studies are highly important&#xA0;&#x2014; if genetic factors are found to be dominant then early detection and understanding of the relative vulnerability of different DNA and tissue variations arguably present the best opportunity to reduce cancer burden. In contrast, if external and environmental risk factors dominate, then lifestyle choice which reduces risk exposure is crucial for this reduction.</p><p>In a 2015 paper by Tomasetti &amp; Vogalstein in&#xA0;<em>Science</em>, the authors conclude that only one-third of cancers are attributable to environmental factors or inherited predispositions; the vast majority result from &#x201C;bad luck,&#x201D; that is the random mutations which can occur when DNA replicates in normal non-cancerous cells.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> This study therefore argued that, beyond some cancer types which are deterministic (D-tumors) and can be reduced through lifestyle factors or vaccines, the most promising approach to reduction of cancer deaths across most cancers (replicative, R-tumors) is early detection.</p><p>This paper has been highly contest within the scientific literature. A number of later publications in&#xA0;<em>Science</em> provided a rebuttal to these conclusions, suggesting analytical flaws in the prior analysis, and epidemiological evidence which suggests otherwise.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a>,<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a>,<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> Such studies have argue that the role of &apos;chance&apos; in cancer development was overstated by Tomasetti &amp; Vogelstein, and the role of environmental exposures was understated. Wu et al. (2016) published in&#xA0;a study in&#xA0;<em>Nature</em> which concluded that intrinsic factors (which relates to the &apos;bad luck&apos; DNA replication) account for less than 10-30 percent of cancer development, with the remaining (majority) share coming from extrinsic risk factors (which are external environmental exposures).<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>The IHME, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study attempt&#xA0;&#x2014; using risk-exposure relationships&#xA0;&#x2014; to provide attribution of certain risk factors to disease burden and mortality outcomes.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a>&#xA0; These risk factors include a wide range, including smoking, diet and nutrition, obesity, alcohol intake, air pollution, &amp; environmental exposures, such as carcinogens.</p><p>In the chart below we see IHME estimates of the share of global cancer deaths which are attributed to one of these major risk factors. For example, 84 percent of tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer deaths are attributed to risk factors such as smoking and air pollution. The remaining share of deaths we would therefore assume no attribution to risk factors, and would occur naturally in the absence of such risks (i.e. deaths from lung cancer which would result if no one smoked, zero air pollution etc.). Note that IHME risk factors do not account for sun exposure, which is a <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/sun-uv-and-cancer/how-the-sun-and-uv-cause-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known risk factor</a> for skin cancer. Attribution for skin cancers in the data below are therefore an underestimate.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-cancer-deaths-attributed-to-risk-factors" class="grapherPreview">

                </figure><h4 id="cancer-survival-rates-by-income"><a class="deep-link" href="#cancer-survival-rates-by-income"></a>Cancer survival rates by income</h4><p>Due to poorer data availability and standardisation of five-year cancer survival rates across the world, it is more difficult to determine any correlations across the full spectrum of incomes. However, in the charts below we show five-year survival rates (following diagnosis), versus GDP per capita for countries with such data available.</p><p>As we see, this relationship can vary significantly depending on cancer type. Five-year survival rates from breast cancer typically show a positive relationship: an increase in average income tends to be correlated to an increase in breast cancer survival rates. This is particularly true at lower-to-middle incomes, with a tailing off towards high incomes. The relationship in lung cancer survival rate is less well-established. There is significant variability in five-year survival rates between countries of a similar income.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/breast-cancer-survival-rates-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview">

<section><h2 id="data-quality-definition"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definition"></a>Data Quality &amp;&#xA0;Definition</h2><p>In this entry we define cancer deaths in three fundamental ways:</p><ul>
<li>Absolute (total) number of cancer deaths;</li>
<li>Cancer death rate: this reports the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals within a given population;</li>
<li>Age-standardized death rate: this reports the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals assuming a constant and consistent age-structure of population between countries and across time.</li>
</ul><p>These measures vary in the information they provide. Absolute (total) number of cancer deaths &amp; prevalence figures provide an important indication of the total cancer burden within a given country or society. This is an important metric for a number of reasons, including the need for management and provision of adequate health services (which is dependent on the total societal burden, not just the incidence or risk for a given individual).</p><p>However, total number of cancer deaths fails to correct for population size and age. Cancer deaths can therefore rise as a result of higher cancer prevalence and/or poorer treatment, but also due to an increase in total population or an aging population. Cancer death rates correct for changes in population&#xA0;<em>size</em>, age-standardized death rates correct for population <em>size and age structure</em>.&#xA0;Age-standardization therefore gives a more indicative measure of the prevalence and incidence of underlying cancer risk factors between countries and with time without the influence of demographic and population structure changes.</p></section>
