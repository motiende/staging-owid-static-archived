The data series for total proved natural gas does not necessarily meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, nor does it necessarily represent BPâ€™s view of proved reserves by country.\"\r\n\r\nThe estimates in this table have been compiled by the BP using a combination of primary official sources and third-party data from Cedigaz and the OPEC Secretariat."}}},"entityKey":{}}
