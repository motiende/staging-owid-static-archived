The HCI is measured in units of productivity relative to a benchmark of complete education and full health, and ranges from 0 to 1. A value of x on the HCI indicates that a child born today can expect to be only x x100 percent as productive as a future worker as she would be if she enjoyed complete education and full health. \n\nRanging between 0 and 1, the index takes the value 1 only if a child born today can expect to achieve full\nhealth (defined as no stunting and survival up to at least age 60) and complete her education potential\n(defined as 14 years of high-quality school by age 18). \n\nHCI is calculated based on the metrics of probability of survival to age 5, expected years of school, harmonized test scores, learning-adjusted years of schooling, stunting and adult survival rates."}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United
