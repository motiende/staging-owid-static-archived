Direct economic loss is nearly equivalent to physical damage. \n\n \n\n[a] An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to \n\ndisaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of \n\nindicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. These indicators \n\nwill eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators. \n\n \n\nComments and limitations: \n\n \n\nNot every country has a comparable national disaster loss database that is consistent with these \n\nguidelines (although current coverage exceeds 89 countries). Therefore, by 2020, it is expected that all \n\ncountries will build/adjust national disaster loss databases according to the recommendations and \n\nguidelines by the OEIWG. \n\n \n\n\f\nData Availability \n\n \n\nDescription: \n\n \n\nAround 100 countries \n\n \n\nThe number of countries with national disaster loss databases using the DesInventar tools and \n\nmethodology currently stands at 89 countries.
