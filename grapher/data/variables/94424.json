It is helpful in understanding whether those who actually drink alcohol consume high or low levels of alcohol. This has direct implications for the drinking population's health outcome.\n\nDefinition\nHeavy episodic drinking (drinkers only)Â is defined as the proportion of adult drinkers (15+ years) who have had at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. A consumption of 60 grams of pure alcohol corresponds approximately to 6 standard alcoholic drinks. Numerator: The appropriately weighted number of drinkers (15+ years) who reported drinking at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. Denominator: The total number of respondents (15+ years, appropriately weighted) to the corresponding survey question(s) who reported having consumed an alcoholic standard drink (10 grams) within the past 12 months on the same survey (or 1-abstainers).\n\nAssociated terms\n\n    \n\nPreferred data sources\nPopulation-based surveys\n\nOther possible data sources\n\n    \n\nMethod of measurement\nSee heavy episodic drinking\n\nMethod of estimation\nWeighted percentages of survey respondents, who reported having consumed an alcoholic drink within the past 12 months.\n\nM&E Framework\n\n    \n\nMethod of estimation of global and regional aggregates\nSurvey estimates weighted by population size of drinkers in corresponding countries.\n\nDisaggregation\nSex\n\nDisaggregation\nAge\n\nUnit of Measure\n\n    \n\nUnit Multiplier\n\n    \n\nExpected frequency of data dissemination\nEvery 3-5 years\n\nExpected frequency of data collection\nEvery 3-5 years\n\nLimitations\nChanging data sources depending on surveys conducted in different countries.\n\nLinks\nGlobal Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH)\n\nLinks\nGlobal Infobase\n\nComments\nPreferred data sources: Internationally comparative, nationally representative population-based surveys.\n\nContact Person\n\n      \n\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
