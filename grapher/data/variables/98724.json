Historic data on under-5 population is derived from the UN Population Division (2017); future projections to 2100 are based on the UN Population Division (2017) median fertility scenario.\n\nThe 'peak child population' is defined as the under-5 population of a given country in its 'peak year' i.e. the maximum under-5 population between 1950 and 2100.\n\nCountries with an under-5 population which is still increasing by the year 2100 are assumed not to have reached peak child."}}},"entityKey":{}}
