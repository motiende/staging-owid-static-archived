This data extends from the year 2000 through to 2016 at national levels, and 2017 estimates by region and at the global level.\n\nFigures at the national level are reported as 3-year averages; here we have allocated these figures to the mid-year. For example, the UN FAO reports national data for \"2014-2016\" which we allocate to the year 2015.\n\nSome data, particularly for high-income countries, is not reported by the UN FAO. This is often the case for countries where the prevalence of undernourishment is less than 2.5% of the total population.\n\nThe categories of Extreme Fragility and Fragile have been added as a variable based on the country groupings defined in the OECD's States of Fragility (2018) Report."}}},"entityKey":{}}
