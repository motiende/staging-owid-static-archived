Alcohol consumption has a causal impact on more than 200 health conditions (diseases and injuries).\n\nAssociated terms\n\n    \n\nPreferred data sources\n\n    \n\nOther possible data sources\n\n    \n\nMethod of measurement\n\n    \n\nMethod of estimation\nPopulation-attributable fractions are calculated based on the level of exposure to alcohol and the risk relations between consumption and different disease or injury categories. For each disease the exact proportion is different and will depend on the level and patterns of alcohol consumption, and on the relative risks.\n\nM&E Framework\n\n    \n\nMethod of estimation of global and regional aggregates\n\n    \n\nDisaggregation\n\n    \n\nUnit of Measure\n\n    \n\nUnit Multiplier\n\n    \n\nExpected frequency of data dissemination\nPeriodic\n\nExpected frequency of data collection\nPeriodic\n\nLimitations\n\n    \n\nLinks\nGlobal Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH)\n\nComments\n\n    \n\nContact Person\n\n      \n\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
