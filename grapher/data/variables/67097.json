In addition, creation and strengthening of NHRIs have also been \nencouraged. For example, the 1993 GA resolution 48/134 ‘affirms the priority that should be accorded to \nthe development of appropriate arrangements at the national level to ensure the effective \n\n\fimplementation of international human rights standards’ while the 2008 GA resolution A/RES/63/169 \nencouraged states ‘to consider the creation or the strengthening of independent and autonomous \nOmbudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions’. The Human Rights Council (HRC \nresolution 5/1, 2007) also called for the effective participation of national human rights institutions in its \ninstitution building package, which provides elements to guide its future work.  \n \nUN treaty bodies have also recognized the crucial role that NHRIs represent in the effective \nimplementation of treaty obligations and encouraged their creation (e.g. CERD General Comment 17, \nA/48/18 (1993); CESCR General Comment 10, E/C.12/1998/25; and CRC General Comment 2, \nCRC/GC/2002/2). A compilation of various recommendations and concluding observations relevant to \nNHRIs emanating from the international human rights mechanisms in the United Nations is available at: \nhttp://www.universalhumanrightsindex.org/.  \n \nThe GANHRI is an international association of NHRIs which promotes and strengthens NHRIs to be in \naccordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human \nrights (ICC Statute, Art. 5). Decisions on the classifications of NHRIs are based on their submitted \ndocuments such as: 1) copy of legislation or other instrument by which it is established and empowered \nin its official or published format (e.g. statute, and /or constitutional provisions, and/or presidential \ndecree, 2) outline of organizational structure including details of staff and annual budget, 3) copy of \nrecent published annual report; 4) detailed statement showing how it complies with the Paris Principles. \nNHRIs that hold ‘A’ and ‘B’ status are reviewed every five years. Civil society organizations may also \nprovide relevant information to OHCHR pertaining to any accreditation matter.  \n \nAccreditation of NHRIs shows that the government supports human rights work in the country. However \ntheir effectiveness should also be measured based on their ability to gain public trust and the quality of \ntheir human rights work. In this context, it would also be worthwhile to look into the responses of the \nNHRI to the recommendations of the GANHRI. Likewise, the inputs from the NHRI while engaging with \nthe international human rights mechanisms (i.e. submissions to the Human Rights Council, including UPR, \nand to the treaty bodies) represent a valuable source of information on how NHRIs carry out their \nmandate in reference to international human rights instruments. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n \n196 countries \n \nAsia and Pacific – 56 \nAfrica – 54 \nLatin America and the Caribbean – 33 \nEurope, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan – 53 \n \nTime series: \n \nFrom 2000 to 2015 \n \n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
