However, despite common principles that are mostly based on the United \n\nNations System of National Accounts, there are still significant problems in international consistency of \n\nnational accounts estimates, based on factors such as differences in the treatment of output in services \n\nsectors, differences in methods used to correct output measures for price changes (in particular, the use of \n\ndifferent weighting systems to obtain deflators) and differences in the degree of coverage of informal \n\neconomic activities. \n\n \n\nMoreover, data on employment used in the denominator of this indicator refer, as much as possible, to the \n\naverage number of persons with one or more paid jobs during the year. That is, the reliability of the \n\nemployment data is also dependent on the degree of coverage of informal activities by the statistical source \n\nused. \n\n \n\nData Availability \n\n \n\nILO estimates are available for 191 countries on a regular basis; Conference Board estimates are available for \n\n121 countries on a regular basis. \n\n \n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
