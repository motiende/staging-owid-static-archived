Surveys \n\nare carried out in a specific period of the year, usually over a few months. However, this indicator can be \n\naffected by seasonality, factors related to food availability (e.g. pre-harvest periods), disease (e.g. rainy \n\nseason and diarrhoea, malaria, etc.), and  natural disasters and conflicts. Hence, country-year estimates \n\nmay not necessarily be comparable over time.
