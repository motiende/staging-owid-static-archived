Regional and global projections are shown for total ozone and ESC for the period\n1960â€“2100, referenced to 1960 values (i.e. 1960 = 0).\n\nData is based on those in Q20-2 in 'Twenty questions and answers about the ozone layer: 2014 update', published as the 2014 edition of the Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol.\n\nData was extracted from the static figure, Q0-1, using the extraction tool WebPlotDigitizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/)."}}},"entityKey":{}}
