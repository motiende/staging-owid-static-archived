(2017).\n\nGeyer et al. (2017) note an average linear rate of increase in recycling of 0.7% per year from 1990 onwards, and 0.7% per year for incineration from 1980 onwards. \n\nData for 1980-2015 is based on historical estimates. Data from 2016-2050 is based solely on extrapolation of consistent growth trends of 0.7% for recycling and incineration; it therefore represents business-as-usual growth but should not be interpreted as a direct projection."}}},"entityKey":{}}
