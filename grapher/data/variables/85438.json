The stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the biologically damaging ultraviolet radiation.\nHydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) were developed as the first major replacement for CFCs. While much less destructive than CFCs, HCFCs also contribute to ozone depletion. They have an atmospheric lifetime of about 1.4 to 19.5 years.\nPoint of contact\nRole: Originator\nPerson: United Nations Envrionment Programme\nOrganization: The Secretariat for the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol\nEmail: Michael.Graber@unep.org\n\nTemporal extent\nCovered time: 1989 - 2014-01-01\nGeographic extent\nCoverage: World"}}},"entityKey":{}}
