The CRA can be used for two different types of assessment: attributable burden and avoidable burden. 'Attributable burden' represents the reduction in current disease burden (or that of a given year) if population exposure had shifted to another counterfactual/hypothetical exposure level; 'avoidable burden' represents the potential future avoided burden if population exposure was to shift to a counterfactual level of exposure. Since the number of deaths is based on current or historical data, the data presented here is that of attributable burden."}},"85881":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":85881,"name":"Indoor (80+ years)","unit":"deaths","description":"","createdAt":"2018-03-07T15:29:09.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-07T15:29:09.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":2495,"sourceId":14714,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"Air pollution deaths breakdown by age - IHME","s_id":14714,"s_name":"Air pollution deaths breakdown by age - IHME","source":{"id":14714,"name":"Air pollution deaths breakdown by age - IHME","dataPublishedBy":"Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network.
