The proportion of children in child \nlabour is calculated as the number of children in child labour divided by the total number of children in the \npopulation.  For the purposes of this indicator, children include all persons aged 5 to 17. This indicator is \ndisaggregated by sex and age group (age bands 5-14 and 15-17) \n \nComments and limitations:  \nChild labour estimates based on the statistical standards set out in the ICLS resolution represent useful \nbenchmarks for international comparative purposes but are not necessarily consistent with estimates based on \nnational child labour legislation. ILO Convention No. 138 contains a number of flexibility clauses left to the \ndiscretion of the competent national authority in consultation (where relevant) with workers’ and employers’ \norganizations (e.g., minimum ages, scope of application).2 This means that there is no single legal definition of \nchild labour across countries, and thus, no single statistical measure of child labour consistent with national \nlegislation across countries. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                           \n1 ILO-IPEC.

Members whose \neconomy and administrative facilities are insufficiently developed may also initially limit the scope of application of the Convention (Art. \n5.1) beyond a core group of economic activities or undertakings (Art. 5.3). \n\n\f\nData Availability  \n\n \nNationally representative and comparable data are currently available for 102 low-and middle-income countries. \n  \n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
