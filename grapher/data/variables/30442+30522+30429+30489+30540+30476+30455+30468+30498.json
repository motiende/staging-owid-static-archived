In the EDGAR database, developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission and the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (JRC/PBL, 2016), the annual data on GHG emissions are available by country, source/sink category, gas and year. The source/sink categories follow the guidelines from IPCC (1997) Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (Olivier et al., 2011, p.8). In this FAOSTAT, Emissions by sector, the source/sink categories from EDGAR have been aggregated into seven sectors. EDGAR data under IPCC categories 4 and 5 (Total Agriculture and Total Land-Use Change and Forestry) have not been included, as these data have been taken from FAOSTAT.
