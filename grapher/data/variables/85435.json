In particular, total amounts of waste produced, rather than apparent consumption, may be used in some areas to derive recycling rates.\nPoint of contact\nRole: Originator\nPerson: Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)\nOrganization: ----\nEmail: env.contact@oecd.org\n\nTemporal extent\nCovered time: 1980 - 2005\nGeographic extent\nCoverage: World"}}},"entityKey":{}}
