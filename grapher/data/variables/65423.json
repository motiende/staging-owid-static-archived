(2017). The authors sourced this data from the Navigant Research series (https://www.navigantresearch.com/).\n\nOurWorldinData have extended this series for the years 2015 and 2016. Cumulative capacity data has been sourced from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Resource, which reports global solar PV installed capacity. Available at: http://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/dashboard/\n\nCost data for the years 2015 and 2016 are sourced from the 'PVX spot market price index for solar PV modules' from Solar Server. These have been calculated as the annual average from monthly spot prices for the Chinese series (which is the closest representation of earlier Navigant data). Prices have been converted from Euros to dollars using a conversion factor of 1.19.\nAvailable at: https://www.solarserver.com/service/pvx-spot-market-price-index-solar-pv-modules.html"}}},"entityKey":{}}
