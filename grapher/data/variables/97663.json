This is measured as the number of abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years old.\n\nThe authors used abortion data from government agencies and compiled data from international sources and nationally representative studies to produce global and regional estimates. Utilising data for 1069 country-years, incidence was estimated using a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the overall abortion rate is a function of the modelled rates in subgroups of women of reproductive age.\n\nData was reported over the period 1990-2014 in five-year intervals. Here we allocate the given data point to the final year of the five-year interval: i.e. \"1994\" denotes the period 1990-1994; \"1999\" denotes 1995-1999; [...], \"2014\" denotes 2010-2014."}}},"entityKey":{}}
