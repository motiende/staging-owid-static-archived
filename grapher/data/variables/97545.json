Earlier historical urbanization estimates for Europe were derived from De Vries (1984), Bairoch et al. (1988), Chandler (1987), for Canada after ad 1890 from Urquhart and Buckley (1965), for China from Rozman (1973) and Maddison (1995), for Colombia from Etter et al. (2006), USA from Dodd (1993), all other countries were estimated similar to De Vries (1984), which data yielded roughly a factor 10 lower in ad 1700 compared with the 1950 value of the UN.\"\n\nFull citation: \nKlein Goldewijk, K. , A.
