It is in fact a subset of\nthe larger number of people at risk. Mass treatment is limited to those living in districts above a threshold level of prevalence; it does not include all people living in districts with any risk of infection. Individual treatment and care is for those who are or have already been infected; it does not include all contacts and others at risk of infection. This number can better be interpreted as the number of people at a level of risk requiring medical intervention â€“ that is, treatment and care for NTDs.\"\n\nFurther details on this variable can be found at: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-03-05.pdf\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
