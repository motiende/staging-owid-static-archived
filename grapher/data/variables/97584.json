This gives a total value of emissions normalised to their CFC11-equivalents. \n\nTotal emissions is inclusive of naturally-occurring and man-made emissions.\n\nData is based on those in Q0-1 in 'Twenty questions and answers about the ozone layer: 2014 update', published as the 2014 edition of the Scientific Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol.\n\nData was extracted from the static figure, Q0-1, using the extraction tool WebPlotDigitizer (https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/).\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
