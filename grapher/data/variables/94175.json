Tobacco dependence treatment is primarily the responsibility of each country’s health-care system. Individual cessation interventions have a significant impact on individual health and are extremely cost-effective compared with many other health system activities. People who quit smoking, regardless of their age, smoking history or health status, experience immediate and profound health benefits and can reduce most of the associated risks within a few years of quitting. This indicator measures the implementation status of the O measure.\n\nDefinition\nInformation from countries on the availability and non-availability of particular tobacco cessation aids is assessed to determine the comparative level of assistance countries provide to help tobacco users quit.\n\nThe groupings for this indicator are:\n1 = Data not reported\n2 = None\n3 = NRT* and/or some cessation services** (neither cost-covered) \n4 = NRT* and/or some cessation services** (at least one of which is cost-covered)\n5 = National quit line, and both NRT* and some cessation services** cost-covered\n* Nicotine replacement therapy.\n** Smoking cessation support available in any of the following places: health clinics or other primary care facilities, hospitals, office of a health professional, the community.\n\nAssociated terms\n\n    \n\nPreferred data sources\nAdministrative sources\n\nOther possible data sources\n\n    \n\nMethod of measurement\n\n    \n\nMethod of estimation\nCountry reported data, scored according to the definition of this indicator.\n\nM&E Framework\n\n    \n\nMethod of estimation of global and regional aggregates\n\n    \n\nDisaggregation\n\n    \n\nUnit of Measure\nN/A\n\nUnit Multiplier\n\n    \n\nExpected frequency of data dissemination\nContinuous\n\nExpected frequency of data collection\n\n    \n\nLimitations\n\n    \n\nLinks\n\n    \n\nComments\n\n    \n\nContact Person\n\n    \n\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
