(2017) project global antibiotic use under business-as-usual antibiotic concentrations and projected meat consumption.\r\n\r\nThe authors also project a number of potential reduction scenarios:\r\n- a global limit of 50 milligrams of antibiotic use per kilogram of meat production.\r\n- a limit of 50 milligrams of antibiotic use per kilogram of meat production for OECD countries & China.\r\n- global per capita meat consumption of 40 grams per day (the equivalent of an average burger patty)\r\n- global per capita meat consumption of 165 grams per day (the projected EU average in 2030)\r\n\r\nProjected global antibiotic use for livestock are shown for each of these potential reduction scenarios."}}},"entityKey":{}}
