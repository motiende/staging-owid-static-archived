Specifically, we excluded the observations where the ICTD indicated concerns about their quality, accuracy or comparability. Details regarding these flags, as well as the dataset more generally, are available Prichard, W. (2016). Reassessing Tax and Development Research: A New Dataset, New Findings, and Lessons for Research. World Development, 80, 48-60.\n\nThe November 2017 version of the ICTD dataset differs from the previous release because of minor revisions to metadata, corrections made to 'Total Revenue' figures for Tunisia, and the addition of a GDP series to the 'merged' file. Revisions made in the <a href=\"https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Data/2017-GRD-Updates.pdf\">July 2017 update</a> are outlined in the linked supporting documentation. \n\nFor more details on the Government Revenue Dataset see its <a href=\"https://www.wider.unu.edu/about-grd\">update history</a>.
