{"variables":{"40839":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":40839,"name":"Pupil-teacher ratio in pre-primary education (headcount basis)","unit":"headcount basis","description":"Average number of pupils per teacher at a given level of education, based on headcounts of both pupils and teachers. Divide the total number of pupils enrolled at the specified level of education by the number of teachers at the same level. In computing and interpreting this indicator, one should take into account the existence of part-time teaching, school-shifts, multi-grade classes and other practices that may affect the precision and meaningfulness of pupil-teacher ratios. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers is converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ teachers; a double-shift teacher is counted twice, etc. Teachers are defined as persons whose professional activity involves the transmitting of knowledge, attitudes and skills that are stipulated in a formal curriculum programme to students enrolled in a formal educational institution.","createdAt":"2017-09-10T12:23:33.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-28T08:58:51.000Z","code":"SE.PRE.ENRL.TC.ZS","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":886,"sourceId":5345,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Teachers","s_id":5345,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Pupil-teacher ratio in pre-primary education (headcount basis)","source":{"id":5345,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Pupil-teacher ratio in pre-primary education (headcount basis)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{}}
