Five category scores are calculated from the unweighted mean of underlying indicators and scaled 0-100, where 100=most favourable. These categories are: Labor policy and practice (comprising two sub-categories: Labor policy and labor practice); Access to Finance; Education and training; Women's legal and social status; and the General business environment. Each category or sub-category features either four or five underlying indicators.\n\nThe overall score (from 0-100) is calculated from a simple average of the unweighted category and indicator variables. That is, every indicator contributes equally to their parent category and every category contributes equally to the overall score.","createdAt":"2018-03-22T13:48:41.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-22T14:50:00.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":2674,"sourceId":14898,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"Women's Economic Opportunity 2012 - Economist Intelligence Unit (2012)","s_id":14898,"s_name":"Women's Economic Opportunity 2012 - Economist Intelligence Unit (2012)","source":{"id":14898,"name":"Women's Economic Opportunity 2012 - Economist Intelligence Unit (2012)","dataPublishedBy":"Economist Intelligence Unit (2012)","dataPublisherSource":"International Labour Organisation (ILO); the World Bank Group; the International Monetary Fund (IMF); the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO); the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division; the UN Secretary-Generalâ€™s database on violence against women; the International Telecommunication Union (ITU); Social Security Online; the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP); the World Economic Forum; the World Health Organisation; Worldwide Governance Indicators; Freedom House; Vision of Humanity; and national statistical offices","link":"https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=weoindex2012","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"The Women's Economic Opportunity (WEO) Index measures five categories to determine whether the environment for both women employees and women entrepreneurs is favourable.
