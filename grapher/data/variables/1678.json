These figures are presented in kgCO2 per international-$ PPP.\r\n\r\nAnnual CO2 emissions data was derived from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC): http://cdiac.ornl.gov/CO2_Emission/ (accessed on 20th April 2017). CDIAC generates estimates of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel consumption and cement production at global and national levels, dating historically to 1751.\r\n\r\nGDP figures are presented in 2011 international-$ PPP based on backward extension of World Bank and Maddison datasets. The data presented here from 1990 onwards is from the World Bank.

Data earlier than 1990 is backwards extended from the World Bank observation for 1990 based on the growth rates implied by Maddison data.
