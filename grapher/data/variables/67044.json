\nThis indicator refers to the proportion of females in the total number of persons employed in senior and \nmiddle management. For the purposes of this indicator, senior and middle management correspond to \nmajor group 1 in both ISCO-08 and ISCO-88 minus category 14 in ISCO-08 (hospitality, retail and other \nservices managers) and minus category 13 in ISCO-88 (general managers), since these comprise mainly \nmanagers of small enterprises. If statistics are not disaggregated at the sub-major level, then major group \n1 of ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 could be used as a proxy. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThis indicator's main limitation is that it does not reflect differences in the levels of responsibility of \nwomen in these high and middle level positions or the importance of the enterprises and organizations in \nwhich they are employed. \n \nIts quality is also heavily dependent on the reliability of the employment statistics by occupation at the \ntwo-digit level of the ISCO. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nNA  \n \n"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"4":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BEL"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"11":{"name":"Poland","code":"POL"},"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"24":{"name":"Austria","code":"AUT"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"31":{"name":"Belize","code":"BLZ"},"35":{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","code":"BIH"},"39":{"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BGR"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"63":{"name":"Uruguay","code":"URY"},"64":{"name":"Tanzania","code":"TZA"},"66":{"name":"Macedonia","code":"MKD"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"83":{"name":"Slovenia","code":"SVN"},"85":{"name":"Slovakia","code":"SVK"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"111":{"name":"Moldova","code":"MDA"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"115":{"name":"Mali","code":"MLI"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"119":{"name":"Lithuania","code":"LTU"},"121":{"name":"Liberia","code":"LBR"},"122":{"name":"Latvia","code":"LVA"},"133":{"name":"Israel","code":"ISR"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"138":{"name":"Hungary","code":"HUN"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"141":{"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LKA"},"142":{"name":"Myanmar","code":"MMR"},"148":{"name":"Guatemala","code":"GTM"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"155":{"name":"Finland","code":"FIN"},"156":{"name":"Estonia","code":"EST"},"158":{"name":"Ethiopia","code":"ETH"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"162":{"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZE"},"163":{"name":"Cyprus","code":"CYP"},"165":{"name":"Croatia","code":"HRV"},"166":{"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CRI"},"201":{"name":"Ecuador","code":"ECU"},"207":{"name":"Iceland","code":"ISL"},"210":{"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LUX"},"212":{"name":"Malta","code":"MLT"},"213":{"name":"Mauritius","code":"MUS"},"219":{"name":"Aruba","code":"ABW"},"233":{"name":"Seychelles","code":"SYC"},"259":{"name":"El Salvador","code":"SLV"},"262":{"name":"Macao","code":"MAC"}}}
