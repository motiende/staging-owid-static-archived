Lower estimates of deaths across the former USSR and Europe from Fairlie and Sumner (2006); and upper estimates from Greenpeace (2005).\r\n\r\nEstimates for Fukushima have been derived from the WHO (2013), and estimated stress-induced deaths in evacuation from the Government of Japan.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nIAEA, WHO (2005/06).
