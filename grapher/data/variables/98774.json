(2018) GPS)","unit":"","description":"Positive reciprocity preferences were measured using one quantitative and one qualitative question. \n\nIn the quantitative item respondents were presented with a scenario where they got lost in an unfamiliar area and a stranger - when asked directions - offered to take them to their destination. Respondents then asked which out of six presents (worth between 5 and 30 euros, or respective country equivalents) they would give to the stranger as a \"thank you\". \n\nRespondents were also asked to provide a self-assessment about how willing they are to return a favor on an 11 point Likert scale.\n\nHigher values indicate the country average for positive reciprocity is above the world average. \n\nThe two items receive roughly equal weights. For more information, see Table I in Falk et al. (2018).

This includes 15 countries from the Americas, 25 from Europe, 22 from Asia and the Pacific, and 14 African countries - 11 of which are Sub-Saharan. In total, this covers 90% of both the world population and total income. \n\nThe median sample size was 1,000 participants per country. The sample includes preference measures for over 80,000 participants altogether. \n\nCountry level averages for each economic preference were calculated using individual-level data weighted by the sampling weights provided by the Gallup World Poll. Each preference is normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the individual-level data.\n\nFor more information on the construction of the GPS dataset, see Section II.A of the paper by Falk et al.
