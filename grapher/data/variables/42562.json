Figures were calculated as the annual total population estimate from the UN Population Division (2017) minus population estimates from the US Census Bureau.\r\n\r\nRelative differences measure this difference in estimates as a percentage of UN figures (i.e. (UN population - US Census Bureau population) / UN population).\r\n\r\nNegative figures therefore represent lower UN estimates vs. US Census Bureau estimates, and vice versa (positive values indicate higher UN estimates).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nUnited Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017).
