{"variables":{"41698":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":41698,"name":"School life expectancy, primary to tertiary, both sexes (years)","unit":"years","description":"Number of years a person of school entrance age can expect to spend within the specified level of education. For a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates. A relatively high SLE indicates greater probability for children to spend more years in education and higher overall retention within the education system. It must be noted that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number of grades of education completed, because of repetition. Since school life expectancy is an average based on participation in different levels of education, the expected number of years of schooling may be pulled down by the magnitude of children who never go to school. Those children who are in school may benefit from many more years of education than the average.","createdAt":"2017-09-10T13:41:47.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-28T08:58:51.000Z","code":"SE.SCH.LIFE","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":900,"sourceId":6204,"shortUnit":"years","display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Tertiary","s_id":6204,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: School life expectancy, primary to tertiary, both sexes (years)","source":{"id":6204,"name":"World Bank EdStats: School life expectancy, primary to tertiary, both sexes (years)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{}}
