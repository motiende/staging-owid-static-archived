{"variables":{"39361":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":39361,"name":"UIS: Adjusted net attendance rate, primary, both sexes (%)","unit":"%","description":"Total number of students of the official primary school age group who attended primary or secondary education at any time during the reference academic year, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) calculates household survey-based education indicators using data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). School participation in household surveys and censuses is commonly measured by whether pupils or students attended a given grade or level of education at least one day during the academic reference year. Therefore, indicators of school participation derived from household survey data refer to attendance, e.g. “net attendance rate” or “adjusted net attendance rate”. The comparable indicator for administrative data is \"Adjusted net enrolment rate, primary\" because the data is based on numbers of students officially enrolled in educational institutions in the stated year.
