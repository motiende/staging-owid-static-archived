{"variables":{"41449":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":41449,"name":"Lower secondary completion rate, both sexes (%)","unit":"%","description":"Total number of new entrants in the last grade of lower secondary education, regardless of age, expressed as percentage of the total population of the theoretical entrance age to the last grade of lower secondary. This indicator is also known as \"Gross intake rate to the last grade of lower secondary general education.\" The ratio can exceed 100 percent due to over-aged and under-aged children who enter lower secondary school late/early and/or repeat grades. Data limitations preclude adjusting for students who drop out during the final year of lower secondary education. Thus this rate is a proxy that should be taken as an upper estimate of the actual lower secondary completion rate.","createdAt":"2017-09-10T13:35:52.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-28T08:58:51.000Z","code":"SE.SEC.CMPT.LO.ZS","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":899,"sourceId":5955,"shortUnit":"%","display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Secondary","s_id":5955,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Lower secondary completion rate, both sexes (%)","source":{"id":5955,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Lower secondary completion rate, both sexes (%)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{}}
