In order to better understand alcohol consumption, we need to combine this information with other information on who drinks and in what pattern. The number of alcohol consumers in the past 12 months provides such information by separating out the drinking from the non-drinking population.\n\nDefinition\nAlcohol consumers in the past 12 months is defined as the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have consumed any alcohol during the past 12 months, assessed at a given point in time. The indicator is calculated with the help of the indicator \"Abstainers (15+ years), past 12 months\" by using 1-abstainers.\n\nAssociated terms\n\n    \n\nPreferred data sources\nPopulation-based surveys\n\nOther possible data sources\n\n    \n\nMethod of measurement\nA representative sample of the adult population (15+ years) of the country is asked to answer questions in a survey. The first priority in the decision tree is given to international surveys (in this order of preference: WHS, STEPS, GENACIS, and ECAS); second is national surveys.\n\nMethod of estimation\nStatistical analyses based on surveys, weighted to be representative for the population.\n\nM&E Framework\n\n    \n\nMethod of estimation of global and regional aggregates\nAverage of countries with representative data weighted by the respective populations.\n\nDisaggregation\nSex\n\nDisaggregation\nAge\n\nUnit of Measure\n\n    \n\nUnit Multiplier\n\n    \n\nExpected frequency of data dissemination\nPeriodic\n\nExpected frequency of data collection\nPeriodic\n\nLimitations\n\n    \n\nLinks\nGlobal Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH)\n\nLinks\nGlobal Infobase\n\nComments\nPreferred data sources: Population-based surveys representative for a country; if possible as part of internationally comparative surveys.\n\nContact Person\n\n      \n\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
