This reflects the fact that the COW data was originally intended for cross-country comparisons at specific points in time, rather than for tracking changes in military expenditure over the long-run.\n\nConsidering this, at Our World in Data (OWID) we have produced a new dataset, based on the COW data, in order to show military expenditure per capita in a single currency, over the long run. Here is a description of what we have done. First, we have extended the military expenditure series in current US dollars up until 2016, appending data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Second, we have used exchange rates published by the Bank of England to unify the entire series into nominal US Dollars. And finally, we have  divided these estimates by total population."}}},"entityKey":{}}
