For example, informal sector enterprises refer to non-registered enterprises in some countries but registration requirements can vary from country to country. Others apply the employment size criterion only (which may vary from country to country). For detailed information on definitions and coverage, see footnotes.\nGeneral comments: Harmonized series\nStatistical concept and methodology: There are wide variations in definitions and methodology of data collection. In addition to employment in the informal economy, informal employment within the formal sector should be also taken into account. Casual, short term, and seasonal workers, for example, could be informally employed â€” lacking social protection, health benefits, legal status, rights and freedom of association. Some countries now provide data according to the guidelines, adopted by the 17th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (2003); Informal employment as the total number of informal jobs, whether carried out in formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises, or households, during a given reference period."}}},"entityKey":{"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"19":{"name":"Angola","code":"AGO"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"22":{"name":"Armenia","code":"ARM"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"34":{"name":"Bolivia","code":"BOL"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"38":{"name":"Brunei","code":"BRN"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"60":{"name":"Zambia","code":"ZMB"},"61":{"name":"Yemen","code":"YEM"},"63":{"name":"Uruguay","code":"URY"},"64":{"name":"Tanzania","code":"TZA"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"66":{"name":"Macedonia","code":"MKD"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"68":{"name":"Uganda","code":"UGA"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"78":{"name":"Eswatini","code":"SWZ"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"89":{"name":"Senegal","code":"SEN"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"98":{"name":"Paraguay","code":"PRY"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"101":{"name":"Pakistan","code":"PAK"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"105":{"name":"Nicaragua","code":"NIC"},"107":{"name":"Nepal","code":"NPL"},"108":{"name":"Namibia","code":"NAM"},"109":{"name":"Mozambique","code":"MOZ"},"111":{"name":"Moldova","code":"MDA"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"115":{"name":"Mali","code":"MLI"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"121":{"name":"Liberia","code":"LBR"},"123":{"name":"Lesotho","code":"LSO"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"139":{"name":"Honduras","code":"HND"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"141":{"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LKA"},"142":{"name":"Myanmar","code":"MMR"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"148":{"name":"Guatemala","code":"GTM"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"166":{"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CRI"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"172":{"name":"Chile","code":"CHL"},"201":{"name":"Ecuador","code":"ECU"},"211":{"name":"Maldives","code":"MDV"},"213":{"name":"Mauritius","code":"MUS"},"238":{"name":"Venezuela","code":"VEN"},"239":{"name":"Samoa","code":"WSM"},"259":{"name":"El Salvador","code":"SLV"},"3897":{"name":"Timor-Leste","code":null}}}
