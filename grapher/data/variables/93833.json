Calculations use Fouquin and Hugot (CEPII 2016) national trade data.\n\nThe time series 'World' corresponds to the World's total exports (imports) (i.e. the sum of exports (imports) reported by all countries in the dataset).\n\nThe total export (import) values of regional income aggregates have been calculated using the World Bank's income groupings. These time series begin in 1970, where the number of countries are more representative. Similarly, total export (import) values by continental grouping begin in 1960. \n\nGermany's time series is comprised of West Germany, and Germany. East Germany has been excluded for the purposes of Germany's calculations.\nRussia's time series comprises Russia and the USSR. "}}},"entityKey":{}}
