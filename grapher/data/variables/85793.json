An explanation of the correction factor algorithm can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/tebbens-et-al-2011-estimation-of-the-number-of-paralytic-polio-cases/ Part of the model input consists of the WHO’s surveillance system that can be found under the second link cited above. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the estimated number of polio cases that disregard any reported cases after a country was certified polio-free and use Tebbens et al.’s (2010) model: \r\nThe WHO’s dataset from 1980 onwards (the first link above) was modified by deleting all documented polio cases after the year in which polio ceased to be endemic in each country (see map and data here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-decade-of-the-last-recorded-case-of-paralytic-polio-by-country).
