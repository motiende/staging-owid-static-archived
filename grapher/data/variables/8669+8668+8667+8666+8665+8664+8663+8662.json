Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.

Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.

Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.

Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.

Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.

Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.

Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.

Firewood consumption has been calculated in a variety of ways by the various authors. Sometimes totals are not included for the later part of the series, even if IEA or other organizations report it. The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.
