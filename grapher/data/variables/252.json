In addition, our measure reflects an objective view of transparency that is readily reproducible by others.\r\n\r\nThe HRV Index focuses on the availability of credible aggregate economic data. It does so by examining patterns of missing data and treating transparency as the latent term which best reflects the tendency to disclose.\"\r\n\r\nThe data is presented in the paper: James R.
