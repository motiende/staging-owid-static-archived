The definitions of 'humanitarian' and 'developmental food aid' are given below.\n\nWithin the overall definition of official development assistance (ODA), humanitarian aid is assistance designed to save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain and protect human dignity during and in the aftermath of emergencies. To be classified as humanitarian, aid should be consistent with the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.\n\nHumanitarian aid includes: disaster prevention and preparedness; the provision of shelter, food, water and sanitation, health services and other items of assistance for the benefit of affected people and to facilitate the return to normal lives and livelihoods; measures to promote and protect the safety, welfare and dignity of civilians and those no longer taking part in hostilities and rehabilitation, reconstruction and transition assistance while the emergency situation persists.

Food aid is categorised and reported in terms of its uses and modes of supply. In terms of the use of food aid, three categories are distinguished: programme food aid is supplied as a resource transfer providing balance of payments (BoP) or budgetary support; project food aid is usually provided to support specific poverty alleviation and disaster prevention activities, targeted on specific beneficiary groups or areas; relief food aid is targeted on, and freely distributed to, victims of natural or man-made disasters. In practice, there has been a blurring of the distinctions between different categories of use, especially in an emergency, crisis situation. The other main approach to distinguish food aid is by looking at its sources or modes of supply: direct transfers, including all food aid originating from a donor country; food aid purchases or exchanges in one developing country for use as food aid in another country; and, local purchases, procured in a country and used as food aid in the same country. This indicator is measured in USD constant prices, using 2016 as the base year.","createdAt":"2018-10-29T15:15:52.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-10-29T15:18:54.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":3087,"sourceId":16222,"shortUnit":null,"display":{"name":"Humanitarian and food aid received","unit":"2016 USD","shortUnit":"$"},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"Humanitarian and food aid received (OECD, 2018)","s_id":16222,"s_name":"Humanitarian and food aid received (OECD, 2018)","source":{"id":16222,"name":"Humanitarian and food aid received (OECD, 2018)","dataPublishedBy":"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)","dataPublisherSource":"","link":"","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"The sum (total) humanitarian and developmental aid received by countries in a given year.
