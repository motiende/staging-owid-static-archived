Hiring refers to the process of employing a person for wages and making a selection by presenting a candidate with a job offer. Job advertisements, selection criteria and recruitment, although equally important, are not considered “hiring” for purposes of this question.","createdAt":"2017-11-14T15:20:47.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-02-28T08:58:53.000Z","code":"SG.LAW.NODC.HR","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2017","datasetId":1047,"sourceId":7026,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"World Bank Gender Statistics - Gender","s_id":7026,"s_name":"World Bank Gender Statistics: Law mandates nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring (1=yes; 0=no)","source":{"id":7026,"name":"World Bank Gender Statistics: Law mandates nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring (1=yes; 0=no)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank Gender Statistics","dataPublisherSource":"World Bank: Women, Business and the Law.","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"Definitions and characteristics of countries and other territories: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/genderstats/GENDERSTATS_Country_info.xls\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
