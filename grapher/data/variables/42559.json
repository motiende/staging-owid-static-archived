Combining caloric losses for each commodity gives the total losses across all commodity types.\n\nThe average caloric supply chain loss per person per day were derived by dividing total caloric losses by a country's total population, and by 365.\n\nReferences:\n\nFAO, Food Balance Sheets: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS [accessed 1st October 2017].\n\nFAO, Food Balance Sheet Handbook (Nutritional Composition Factors): http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x9892e/X9892e01.htm [accessed 1st October 2017]."}}},"entityKey":{}}
