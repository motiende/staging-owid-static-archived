All data from 1965 onwards, with the exception of traditional biomass is sourced from BP Statistical Review. Smil's estimates of traditional biomass have been used for the full series, with interpolation of annual changes by Our World in Data between reported 5-year increments by Smil. Traditional biomass for the years 2016 and 2017 have been estimated based on the approximate rate of change in the previous 5 years from Smil data.\n\nOur World in Data has normalised all BP data to terawatt-hours (TWh) using a conversion factor of 11.63 to convert fossil fuel energy sources from million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) to TWh.\n\nData represents primary energy (rather than final energy) consumption. 'Other renewables' represents all renewable sources minus solar, wind, and hydropower (e.g. geothermal, wave and tidal, and modern biofuels).\n\n\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
