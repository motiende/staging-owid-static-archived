It is based on \ngenuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of \nThreatened Species (IUCN 2015) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1. \n \nComments and limitations: \nThere are four main sources of uncertainty associated with Red List Index values and trends. \n \n\na. \n\nInadequate,  incomplete  or  inaccurate  knowledge  of  a  speciesâ€™  status.  This  uncertainty  is \nminimized by assigning estimates of extinction risk to categories that are broad in magnitude and \ntiming. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nb.  Delays in knowledge about a species becoming available for assessment. Such delays apply to a \nsmall (and diminishing) proportion of status changes, and can be overcome in the Red List Index \nthrough back-casting. \n\nc. \n\nInconsistency  between  species  assessments.  These  can  be  minimized  by  the  requirement  to \nprovide supporting documentation detailing the best available data, with justifications, sources, \nand  estimates  of  uncertainty  and  data  quality,  which  are  checked  and  standardized  by  IUCN \nthrough Red List Authorities, a Red List Technical Working Group and an independent Standards \nand Petitions Sub-committee. Further, detailed Guidelines on the Application of the Categories \nand Criteria are maintained (IUCN SPSC 2016), as is an online training course (in English, Spanish \nand French). \n\nd.  Species that are too poorly known for the Red List Criteria to be applied are assigned to the Data \nDeficient category, and excluded from the calculation of the Red List Index. For birds, only 0.8% \nof  extant  species  are  evaluated  as  Data  Deficient,  compared  with  24%  of  amphibians.  If  Data \nDeficient  species  differ  in  the  rate  at  which  their extinction risk  is  changing,  the Red  List  Index \nmay give a biased picture of the changing extinction risk of the overall set of species. The degree \nof  uncertainty  this  introduces  is  estimated  through  a  bootstrapping  procedure  that  randomly \nassigns  each  Data  Deficient  species  a  category  based  on  the  numbers  of  non-Data  Deficient \nspecies in each Red List category for the set of species under consideration, and repeats this for \n1,000 iterations, plotting the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles as lower and upper confidence intervals for \nthe median. \n\n \nThe main limitation of the Red List Index is related to the fact that the Red List Categories are relatively \nbroad measures of status, and thus the Red List Index for any individual taxonomic group can practically \nbe updated at intervals of at least four years. As the overall index is aggregated across multiple \ntaxonomic groups, it can be updated typically annually. In addition, the Red List Index does not capture \n\n\fparticularly well the deteriorating status of common species that remain abundant and widespread but \nare declining slowly. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nThe Red List Index has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all \ncountries in the world, and these are updated on a regular basis (approximately once every four years). \n \nTime series: \nSince 1980 (approximately 35 years).  \n \n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
