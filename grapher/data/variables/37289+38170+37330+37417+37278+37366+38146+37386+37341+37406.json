Exceptionally, unofficial data are also used as well as estimated/imputed data. In both cases this is \"flagged\". Data are recorded as countries report them, except for eliminating obvious errors. The source data can originate from surveys, administrative data and estimates based on expert observations. Which type of source is used by countries affect significantly reliability and comparability of data.","link":"http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/?#data/","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"\r\n\t: \r\nFood Balance Sheets (FBS) are compiled every year by FAO, mainly with country-level data on the production and trade of food commodities. Using these data and the available information on seed rates, waste coefficients, stock changes and types of utilization (feed, food, processing and other utilization), a supply/utilization account is prepared for each commodity in weight terms. The food component of the commodity account, which is usually derived as a balancing item, refers to the total amount of the commodity available for human consumption during the year. Besides commodity-by-commodity information, the FAO FBS also provide total food availability estimates by aggregating the food component of all commodities including fishery products. From these values and the available population estimates, the per person dietary energy and protein and fat supplies are derived and expressed on a daily basis. In the FBS production data refer only to primary products while data for all other elements also include processed products derived there from, expressed in primary commodity equivalent.\r\n\r\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
