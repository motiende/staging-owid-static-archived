To differentiate 'conflict' deaths, we have subtracted number of terrorism deaths published by the GTD from this combined metric of 'Conflict and Terrorism'. \n\nWe have also calculated both of these individual parameters in terms of the percentage of total deaths, by dividing by IHME figures of deaths for 'All causes'.\n\nNote that in some cases, estimates of homicide, conflict and terrorism can be challenging to differentiate, with different estimates from different sources and definitions. For terrorism, we have used data from the GTD; full data and definitions can be found at our entry: www.ourworldindata.org/terrorism\n\nSources:\nIHME, GBD: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool\nGTD: http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/"}}},"entityKey":{}}
