To compare Murdock's figures to contemporary data available from the World Bank’s Fifty Years of Women’s Legal Rights database, a dichotomous scheme had to be used where 0 indicates inequality and 1 equality.\n\nFor further information of these data, see the link above from page 221, under the heading \"Historical sources\".
