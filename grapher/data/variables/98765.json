Data from these sources has been cross-checked with data from the EMDAT database (http://www.emdat.be/). The former two sources in general report slightly higher economic losses relative to EMDAT.\n\nThis has been normalized to economic losses from disasters as a share of global gross domestic product (GDP) based on global GDP data derived from the World Bank.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
