However, for Canada, Germany, Great Britain and the US, we combined estimates from Long (1958) and Heckman and Killingsworth (1986), in order to provide a longer perspective. Details on how we combined these sources can be found in this online table (https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/OECD-historical-female-participation-OWID.xlsx).\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that OECD estimates correspond to population ages 15+, while other estimates correspond to population 14+. Also, for France 1962-1966 we assigned missing values where the OECD.stat file reports zero."}}},"entityKey":{}}
