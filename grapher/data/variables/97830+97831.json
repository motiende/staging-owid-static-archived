For example, the figures for 1650 are based on evidence found  for the period 1640-1660. When available evidence refers to years outside the 20 year periods (e.g. for 1625 and 1680) an interpolated estimate is made using the straight-line method, for the intervening 50-year interval date, 1650. \n\nRegional definitions are as follows: \nNorth and west consist of: Scandinavia, England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Netherlands, and Belgium\nCentral: Germany, France, and Switzerland\nMediterranean: Northern Italy, Central Italy, Southern Italy, Spain, and Portugal\nEastern: Austria-Bohemia, and Poland\n\nEurope consists of the North and west, Central, Mediterranean, and Eastern regions.\nThe Low Countries (also known as the Benelux countries) include Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\nThe rest of northern Europe includes all countries not already included as part of the British Isles or the Low Countries.\n\nDe Vries excludes Russia and Orthodox Europe noting for \"the period 1500-1800 the cities of the Russian and Ottoman empires possessed characteristics so distinctive that it would be misleading to include them in a single study with western and central Europe. [...] Hungary [...] is excluded because of the difficulty gaining information for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when most of Hungary was under Ottoman control. [...] Lithuania's exclusion and that of the Baltic states is required by the combination of insufficient information and boundary changes.\""}}},"entityKey":{"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"4":{"name":"Belgium","code":"BEL"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"11":{"name":"Poland","code":"POL"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"278":{"name":"England and Wales","code":null},"358":{"name":"Scotland","code":null},"37542":{"name":"Scandinavia","code":null},"37915":{"name":"Northern Italy","code":null},"37916":{"name":"Central Italy","code":null},"37917":{"name":"Southern Italy","code":null},"37918":{"name":"Austria-Bohemia","code":null},"37930":{"name":"North and west region","code":null},"37931":{"name":"Central region","code":null},"37932":{"name":"Mediterranean region","code":null},"37933":{"name":"Eastern region","code":null}}}
