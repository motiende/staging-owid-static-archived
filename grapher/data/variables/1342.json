The indicator is computed by comparing a probability distribution of habitual daily dietary energy consumption with a threshold level called the minimum dietary energy Requirement. Both are based on the notion of an average individual in the reference population.  \n\nThis is the traditional FAO hunger indicator, adopted as official Millennium Development Goal indicator for Goal 1, Target 1.9.\n\nThe indicator is calculated in three year averages, from 1990-92 to 2014-16 at regional and national levels, to reduce the impact of possible errors in estimated DES, due to the difficulties in properly accounting of stock variations in major food.\n\nAll the countries and regions as reported by the Millenniumn Development Goals (MDG) regional classification.\n\nThe aggregates are computed using a weighted population average.\n\nMore details on the methodology for computing the prevalence of undernourishment are in \"Annex 2\" of the \"State of Food Insecurity in the World 2015\" Report (http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/)."}}},"entityKey":{}}
