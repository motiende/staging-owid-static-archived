A brief presentation on the project is available on voxeu.org http://voxeu.org/article/recasting-international-income-differences-next-generation-penn-world-table . New versions of the Penn World Table are updated regularly. The most recent one, employed to build this dataset, was published in 2015.\n\nList of variables and how these were manipulated:\n\nPWT's country names were modified according to OWID standardized country names.\n\nTotal GDP (output):Output-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in unit 2011US$). Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"rgdpo\" by 1.000.000.\n\nTotal GDP (expenditure): Expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in unit 2011US$). Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"rgdpe\" by 1.000.000.\n\nPopulation: Population. Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"pop\" by 1.000.000.\n\nLiving Standard GDP per Capita: Per Capita expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs. Calculated dividing Total GDP (expenditure) by Population.\n\nPersons Engaged: Number of persons engaged. Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"emp\" by 1.000.000.\n\nWork Hours Per Person: Average annual hours worked by persons engaged. Present in PWT(9.0)'s as \"avh\".\n\nWork Hours: Total number of work hours. Calculated multiplying \"Work Hours per Person\" by \"Persons Engaged\".\n\nLabour Productivity: Labour Productivity. Calculated dividing \"Total GDP (output)\" by \"Total number of work hours\".\n\nShare Of Labour Compensation: Share of labour compensation in GDP at current national prices. Present in PWT(9.0) as \"labsh\".\n\nGDP Price Level: Price level of CCON (PPP/XR), price level of USA GDPo in 2011=1. Present in PWT(9.0) as \"pl_con\".\n\nrgdpe: Expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in mil. 2011US$). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"rgdpe\".\n\nrgdpo: Output-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in mil. 2011US$). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"rgdpo\".\n\npop: Population (in millions). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"pop\".\n\nemp: Number of persons engaged (in millions). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"emp\".\n\nctfp: TFP level at current PPPs (USA=1). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"ctfp\".\n\ncwtfp: Welfare-relevant TFP levels at current PPPs (USA=1). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"cwtfp\".\n\nrtfpna: TFP at constant national prices (2011=1). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"rtfpna\".\n\nrwtfpna: Welfare-relevant TFP at constant national prices (2011=1). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"rwtfpna\".\n\nStatcap: Statistical capacity indicator (source: World Bank, developing countries only). Present in PWT(9.0) as \"Statcap\"."}}},"entityKey":{}}
