<p>The content and structure in the current version do not yet cover all the key aspects we intend to cover. We plan to revise and extend the material in the future.</p></div><p>Human height is determined by a combination of genetics and environmental factors making it an active area of research in both the sciences and social sciences. Recent breakthroughs in sequencing the human genome have allowed identification of 697 genetic variants that influence the height of an individual.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a>&#xA0;Although genetics plays an important role in understanding variation within a given population, human growth can be limited by poor childhood nutrition and illness. This makes height strongly correlated with living standards and hence a good proxy for them. Changes to heights over time and within countries paints a picture of economic development. One major advantage of using height as a proxy is the availability of data in the pre-statistical period.</p><p>It is important to stress that height is not used as a direct measure of well-being. In the absence of any abnormality or extremes, we should not expect that changing an individual&#x2019;s height makes them any more or less happy all other things being equal.</p></section>

However, non-genetic, environmental factors during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence &#x2013; such as nutrition and health &#x2013; also have an impact on growth trends. As such, variations in height across the world <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/human-height#what-explains-differences-in-human-height">indicate</a> not only genetic differences, but also general differences in living standards.</p><p>Here, we examine variations in mean male and female heights by country. We use the most recent global study, published by NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) in 2016.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> This dataset was sourced from publicly available measurement surveys &#x2013; such as demographic and health surveys &#x2013; and academic studies. It reports mean height for adults by year of birth, from 1896 to 1996; in other words, people who had reached their eighteenth birthday from 1914 to 2014.</p><p><b>How tall are men across the world?</b></p><p>The global mean height of adult men born in 1996 is 171 centimetres (cm), or 5 foot and 7.5 inches. There are large variations in average height between nations: the shortest being men in Timor at 160 cm, and the tallest from the Netherlands at 182 cm. This represents a range of 22 cm, or 8 inches.</p><p>There are also clear distinctions between regions. On average, the shortest men can be found in South Asia, where the average height is 165 cm, while the tallest are from Europe and Central Asia, at 177 cm.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/average-height-of-men" class="grapherPreview">

But how much taller, and how does this vary across the world?</p><p>Globally, the mean height of women is about four and a half inches, or 12 centimeters (cm), shorter than that of men. In the latest available data, the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/average-height-by-year-of-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global mean height</a> for men was 171 cm, versus 159 cm for women.</p><p>Interestingly, this height disparity between the sexes is present everywhere in the world. It&#x2019;s largest in Macedonia, where men are typically 18.5 cm taller than women, and smallest in Gambia, where the mean difference is only 4.5 cm. You can see the absolute difference in mean heights for any country in the world <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/average-height-by-year-of-birth">here</a>.</p><p>The scatter plot below illustrates the difference between the average heights of men and women around the world. It plots average male height on the y-axis, and average female height on the x-axis. The grey line shows where these heights are equal. As we can see, all countries lie above this line; this means that on average, men are taller than women in every country in the world.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/mean-height-males-vs-females" class="grapherPreview">

Globally, the ratio is 1.07, meaning that on average, men are about 7% taller than women.</p><p>Across the world, this relative difference between the sexes can vary from only 2 to 3% to over 12%. Regionally, the gap in mean height between men and women is smallest across Sub-Saharan Africa: there, many countries lie below the global average difference of 7%.</p><p>Curiously, the global ratio &#x2013; around 1.07 &#x2013; has remained pretty much constant since the data began in 1896 despite large increases in absolute terms in the average heights of both men and women.</p><p>Despite a relatively consistent ratio at the global level, some countries have seen significant changes. A century ago, South Korean males were on average 18 cm taller than their female counterparts; this difference has fallen to 13 cm, meaning that South Korean women have seen larger absolute gains in height than South Korean men. By contrast, in the Philippines this difference has doubled from 7 cm to 14 cm, meaning that average height of Filipino men has increased faster than that of Filipino women.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/male-to-female-height-ratio" class="grapherPreview">

But when does this differentiation in heights take place? How do the growth trends for boys and girls in childhood differ?</p><p>The chart below presents the expected growth rates for healthy boys and girls during childhood and adolescence. It combines data from World Health Organization (WHO) growth reference standards for infants, children, and adolescents. These standards are used to assess the degree to which the health and nutritional demands for growth and development are met around the world. The studies included healthy children from a diverse set of ethnicities, in order to reduce the impact of genetic variability between populations.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a><a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>As the chart shows, boys are typically a fraction taller than girls at birth. Both sexes grow very quickly in the first six months of life, with this growth rate decreasing gradually during the following years. After three years of life, both boys and girls have approximately doubled in height since birth, but boys are still slightly taller.</p><p>By the age of eight, the rate of growth for boys begins to slow, but does not typically slow for girls. Around the age of nine, we see that girls often overtake boys.</p><p>At 11 years old, girls are typically more than two centimeters taller than boys. This is when the rate of growth of girls finally begins to slow. In contrast, boys start to grow faster. Around the age of 13, boys overtake again.</p><p>Girls tend to stop growing a few years earlier than boys,reaching their final adult height around 16 years old. Boys peak later, at around 18 years old. At this stage, they&#x2019;re 13 centimeters taller than girls on average.</p><p>Of course, not all children grow at the same rate or will reach the same height as adults. The ribbons around the median growth lines on the chart represent two standard deviations above and below the median expected trend. Heights which fall within two standard deviations of the median are considered to be &#x2018;healthy growth&#x2019;. A child whose height-for-age falls below this ribbon is considered to be &#x2018;stunted&#x2019;: defined as having a height too short for their age.</p><p>Stunting typically occurs during the first two years of life, since this is when growth is fastest and nutritional requirements are greatest. This means environmental factors have an important effect.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> There is evidence to suggest that &#x2018;catch-up growth&#x2019; - growth that is faster than normal for age and follows a period of growth inhibition - is possible if environmental factors improve.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a><a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>The expected average height of a healthy global population should be 163 cm for women and 176.5 cm for men &#x2013; as defined by the WHO growth reference standards. Interestingly, the global average height is 159.5 cm for women, and 171 cm for men - it&#x2019;s lower than we&#x2019;d expect. This disparity between the actual and expected global average height may be due to the fact that historically, and still today, a large share of children are stunted. In 1990, around 40% were stunted. It has fallen since then to around 22% in 2017, but with large variations across the world.</p><p><a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2019/06/Healthy20height20growth20curves.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23871 size-large" src="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2019/06/Healthy20height20growth20curves-633x550.png" alt width="633" height="550"></a></p></section>

We see this data in the charts below.</p><p>Human height has steadily increased over the past 2 centuries across the globe. This trend is in line with general improvements in health and nutrition during this period. Historical data on heights tends to come from soldiers (conscripts), convicted criminals, slaves and servants. It is for this reason much of the historical data focuses on men.

<section><h2 id="are-increases-in-human-height-stagnating"><a class="deep-link" href="#are-increases-in-human-height-stagnating"></a>Are increases in human height stagnating?</h2><p>Human height for both men and women has <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/human-height#a-century-of-human-height-how-has-adult-height-changed-over-time">increased over the past century</a>: this is true of every country in the world. But, over the last few decades, &#xA0;human height in some countries have been stagnating. This is illustrated in the following charts which show the year-on-year relative change in average male and female heights by region. Positive values here indicate an increase in average height from one year to the next; zero indicates no change; and negative indicates a decline.</p><p>Here we can pull out several key points. Firstly, we see that changes in height across the world are gradual: average heights do not suddenly jump one year to the next, but instead tend to change at rates of less than 1% per year. Secondly, we see that across all regions, average human heights have experienced significant growth over the past century. But the trends also suggest that growth in average male heights have stagnated in Europe and Central Asia, while reversing in the Middle East and North Africa, East Asia and Pacific, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The story is largely the same for women, but with the addition that average female heights in North America have stagnated as well.</p><p>This seems like an unexpected result. Human height is positively <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/human-height#what-explains-differences-in-human-height">correlated with standards of living</a>; living standards have been increasing across the world in recent decades, so why would average human heights be stagnating or even falling? This trend is particularly curious for Sub-Saharan Africa, where average height appears to be falling the most while the <a href="https://africaindata.org/#/title-slide">region has simultaneously achieved progress</a> across many aspects of wellbeing.</p><p>In the next section we explore why this might be the case.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-change-in-average-male-height" class="grapherPreview">

Evolution aside, the genes of a population are fixed.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> As such, it is reasonable to assume that there is an upper limit to average heights, at which nutritional and health factors are optimal. This scenario could explain the recent stagnation, especially in high income countries across &#xA0;Europe and Central Asia, where living standards are high.</p><p>A study published in <i>Nature</i> examined the recent stagnation of heights in the Netherlands, the tallest population in the world.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> They found similar results: that the 150 year increase in average heights in the Netherlands had came to an end in recent decades. They concluded that the reason for this is not entirely clear. They suggest that the Dutch may have reached the maximum mean height possible for the population. But they also hypothesised that recent lifestyle changes &#x2013; not a genetic upper bound &#x2013; may be hindering further increases in the average heights of men and women. For example, &#x201C;easy access to fast food nowadays &#x2026; may lead to inadequate nutrient intake, which may result in lower height&#x201D;. Furthermore, &#x201C;less energy expenditure due to a sedentary lifestyle leads to an increase in overweight and obesity &#x2026; which, in turn, are related to lower height&#x201D;.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> Additionally, &#x201C;the high consumption of milk in the Netherlands, which has been linked to tallness, declined over the past decade from 63 litres per capita per year in 2000 to 60 in 2010&#x201D;.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> Therefore, the positive height trend in high-income countries may return if lifestyles improve.</p><p>Other studies have assessed the apparent stagnation, or slowed growth, in other high-income regions.

The study attributes this partly to nutrition, arguing that &#x201C;there are reasons to believe that US diets are deficient to some extent as nearly a half of households&apos; food expenditure is spent on food outside of the home.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a> This is troubling insofar as meals consumed outside of the home are less balanced than those consumed at family dinners.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> It also highlights &#x201C;differences in the socio-economic and health systems of the West and Northern European welfare states and the more market-oriented economy of the USA&#x201D;, arguing that &#x201C;socio-economic inequality in America is much greater than in Western Europe and inequality has a negative effect on mean height.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a> Furthermore, the West European welfare states, in which a subsistence income is more or less guaranteed, provide a more comprehensive social safety net including unemployment insurance and a comprehensive health-insurance coverage.&#x201D;<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><h3 id="why-has-average-human-height-in-sub-saharan-africa-fallen"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-has-average-human-height-in-sub-saharan-africa-fallen"></a>Why has average human height in Sub-Saharan Africa fallen?</h3><p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, the pattern is even more puzzling.

It is made up of basic building blocks called amino acids. Some amino acids - known as the nutritionally essential amino acids - cannot be made in the body, and so must come from the diet. Diets must provide adequate quantities of the full range of amino acids for human growth and metabolism.

But even larger height disparities begin to arise at high levels of animal protein intake.</p><p>In high-income countries, where animal protein intake is high, Grasgruber (2014) found that the strongest predictor of male height is the ratio of high-quality animal proteins - from milk products, red meat, and fish - to low-quality plant proteins - from wheat, rice and other cereals.<a id="ref-35" class="ref" href="#note-35"><sup>35</sup></a> This could explain why some countries with very high socioeconomic status have shorter heights than we&#x2019;d expect. Consider the difference between South Korea and the Netherlands: both have a very high HDI &#x2013; over 0.9 &#x2013; but the Dutch are nearly 8 centimeters taller (182.5 cm versus 175 cm). What separates them is their intake of animal protein: the Netherlands&#x2019; animal:plant protein ratio is 2.16 versus only 0.69 in South Korea.</p><p>Appropriate mixtures of plant source proteins - such as cereals plus legumes or oil seeds - are capable of providing the essential amino acids and micronutrients necessary for growth. However, <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/diet-compositions">diets </a>in low-income countries are often dependent on a single staple food source. In Bangladesh, for example, over 75% of dietary energy comes from cereals and grains, 90% of which is rice.

As such, low-income countries are unlikely to exhibit enough dietary diversity.</p><p>Animal proteins form an <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/diet-compositions#animal-based-foods-form-a-larger-part-of-our-diet-as-we-get-richer">increasingly</a> large part of our diets as income increases.

Disease during childhood can restrict growth because it reduces the availability of nutrients and raises metabolic requirements.<a id="ref-37" class="ref" href="#note-37"><sup>37</sup></a> Children fighting disease have higher nutritional requirements during a period when nutrients are less available. As such, high incidences of disease should lead to shorter average heights.</p><p>Grasgruber (2016)&#xA0;found that the socioeconomic factor most strongly correlated with male height is child mortality.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a> This relationship is illustrated in the scatter plot below, with child mortality rate on the y-axis and mean male height on the x-axis.&#xA0;A low child mortality rate suggests low incidences of disease, as well as sufficient nourishment, and hence predicts a taller average height. For example, 0.2% of children in Finland die before they are 5 years old compared to 7.4% of children in Afghanistan; the average male heights in Finland is significantly taller at 180 cm versus 165 cm.</p><p>The relationship between health and height is reinforced by the significant impact of healthcare expenditure. We see this reflected in Arab states where health expenditure is much lower than their income level would predict. For example, compare Oman and the Netherlands: the average male height of the Dutch is 182cm &#x2013; 13 centimeters taller than the average in Oman. Both countries have high levels of <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/maddison-data-gdp-per-capita-in-2011us?tab=chart&amp;time=1950..2016&amp;country=NLD+OMN">income per capita</a>. But the Netherlands spends much more on <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-healthcare-expenditure-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;time=1995..2014&amp;country=NLD+OMN">healthcare</a>: healthcare expenditure per capita in Oman is $1,442, or 3.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) versus $5,202, or 9.2% of GDP in the Netherlands.</p><p>Both child mortality and healthcare expenditure impact life expectancy: we would therefore expect them to be strong determinants of the relationship between standard of living and average height.</p><p>Total <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/fertility-rate">fertility rate</a> (the number of children per woman) also interacts with these determinants, making it the second strongest socioeconomic correlate of height. The role of fertility in high-income countries is marginal since fertility rates are already very low. But it gains statistical significance at lower incomes, where fertility rates are relatively high. In families where there are a large number of children, expenditure and food availability for each child is often lower. We might therefore expect that in countries where the fertility rate is high, health expenditure and nutritional quality per child is low, while incidence of disease is high.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-rate-vs-mean-male-height-cm" class="grapherPreview">

This could help to explain disparities in average heights around the world. Certain haplogroups &#x2013; groups of variant clusters that are inherited from one common ancestor &#x2013; have observable associations with height.</p><p>For example, one haplogroup (J1-M267) is most commonly observed in populations that spread from the Zagros mountains in Iran to the Arabian peninsula, particularly Yemen.<a id="ref-41" class="ref" href="#note-41"><sup>41</sup></a> Another haplogroup (R1b-S116) is often found in populations from Ireland, Britain, France, and Iberia, who probably migrated from the Franco-Cantabrian region.<a id="ref-42" class="ref" href="#note-42"><sup>42</sup></a> These haplogroups are associated with short stature.</p><p>By contrast, one haplogroup (I-M170) is most concentrated in Germanic-speaking Europe, and the Western Balkans, particularly Herzegovina.<a id="ref-43" class="ref" href="#note-43"><sup>43</sup></a>&#xA0;These regions are characterised by tallness, which strongly suggests a correlation between this haplogroup and height.</p><h3 id="is-height-determined-by-nature-or-nurture"><a class="deep-link" href="#is-height-determined-by-nature-or-nurture"></a>Is height determined by nature or nurture?</h3><p>Is height determined by genetics or environment? The short answer is that it depends on the countries you are comparing. Differences in average heights could be due to different genes, different environments, or &#x2013; more likely &#x2013; some combination of both.</p><p>For instance, the average male height in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 181 cm &#x2013; far higher than the global mean of 171 cm, and even the regional mean of 177 cm. This height cannot be explained by high standards of living nor high animal protein consumption: its HDI is one of the lowest in Europe, and the ratio of animal protein to plant protein consumption is only 0.33, compared to 2.16 in the Netherlands. The cause in this case must be genetic: nature over nurture.</p><p>Differences in average heights between North and South Korea tell a very different story, as told by Pak (2005).<a id="ref-44" class="ref" href="#note-44"><sup>44</sup></a> The two halves of the Korean Peninsula share a genetic lineage, but since the partition in 1945 there has been a great divergence in average heights. While the average height of South Korean men increased by 3.8 cm &#x2013; one of the largest increases in the world &#x2013; North Korean men of comparable ages grew only 0.8 cm. This disparity is much more likely to be due to differences in standards of living: nurture over nature.</p><p>The equation that determines human height is made up of many components. No single factor can predict height at an individual or even a national level. But overall, average heights can offer a unique insight into the genetic makeup and standard of living of a population.</p></section>

But this tells us very little about the distribution of heights globally, regionally or within in a given country. How do heights vary: do most people have heights very similar to the average; or do they span a wide range?</p><h3 id="what-does-the-distribution-of-heights-look-like"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-does-the-distribution-of-heights-look-like"></a>What does the distribution of heights look like?</h3><p>Adult heights within a population are approximately normally distributed due to genetic and environmental variance.<a id="ref-45" class="ref" href="#note-45"><sup>45</sup></a> Height is partly determined by the interaction of 423 genes with 697 variants.<a id="ref-46" class="ref" href="#note-46"><sup>46</sup></a> One of the basic rules of probability (known as the Central Limit Theorem) says the distribution of a trait that is determined by independent random variables, like height and genes, roughly follows a bell curve. This means the range of human heights in a population fall centrally around the mean height. In statistical terms, it&#x2019;s also the case that the mean and median height are the same &#x2013; they fall right in the middle of the distribution.<a id="ref-47" class="ref" href="#note-47"><sup>47</sup></a></p><p>The normal distribution of heights allows us to make inferences&#xA0;about the range. Around 68% of heights will fall within one standard deviation of the mean height; 95% within two standard deviations; and 99.7% within three. If we know the mean and standard deviation of heights, we have a good understanding of how heights vary across a population.</p><p>Drawing upon height data from almost 150,000 twinned pairs born between 1886 and 1994, one study investigated the variance in heights across populations through time, and tried to explain how much could be explained by genetics versus environmental differences.<a id="ref-48" class="ref" href="#note-48"><sup>48</sup></a> We see this distribution of heights in the chart below. As an aggregate of the regions with available data &#x2013; Europe, North America, Australia, and East Asia &#x2013; they found the mean male height to be 178.4 centimeters (cm) in the most recent cohort (born between 1980 and 1994).<a id="ref-49" class="ref" href="#note-49"><sup>49</sup></a> The standard deviation was 7.59 cm. This means 68% of men were between 170.8 and 186 cm tall; 95% were between 163.2 and 193.6 cm. Women were smaller on average, with a mean height of 164.7 cm, and standard deviation of 7.07 cm. This means 68% of women were between 157.6 and 171.8 cm; and 95% between 150.6 and 178.84 cm.</p><p>Regionally, the standard deviation of male heights is largest in North America and Australia, at 7.49 cm, and smallest in East Asia, at 6.37 cm. The pattern is the same for women, with 6.96 cm in North America and Australia, and 5.74 cm in East Asia. Some of the distribution of heights within a population is likely to reflect the degree of genetic variance.<a id="ref-50" class="ref" href="#note-50"><sup>50</sup></a></p><p><a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2019/06/distribution-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23884" src="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2019/06/distribution-1-775x550.png" alt width="775" height="550"></a></p><h3 id="how-does-environment-and-living-standards-affect-the-distribution-of-heights"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-does-environment-and-living-standards-affect-the-distribution-of-heights"></a>How does environment and living standards affect the distribution of heights?</h3><p>Differences in height within a population are not only influenced by genetic variance. Greater environmental variance within a population is also reflected by a wider distribution of heights. The distribution of heights has therefore be used as one indicator of socioeconomic inequality in the past.<a id="ref-51" class="ref" href="#note-51"><sup>51</sup></a></p><p>In a population with perfectly equal access to nutrition and health resources, height distribution would only reflect genetic variation. Unequal access to these resources within a population means that wealthier individuals could have better health and nutrition, and therefore tend to grow taller than poorer ones; variance of heights therefore becomes larger. In other words, resource-based variance due to income inequality is added to genetic variance, widening the distribution of heights. Some empirical evidence across a range of contexts would support this hypothesis.</p><p>For example, in India in the twentieth-century, an individual&#x2019;s caste had a significant influence on their height. Members of the high castes &#x2013; who had better access to nutrition and health resources &#x2013; were 4.5 cm taller on average than members of the low castes.<a id="ref-52" class="ref" href="#note-52"><sup>52</sup></a> Genetic differences between caste groups are unlikely to account for this height difference, due to the population&#x2019;s common genetic heritage.<a id="ref-53" class="ref" href="#note-53"><sup>53</sup></a></p><p>Furthermore, Ayuda (2014) identified a relationship between socioeconomic status and height among Spanish conscripts from 1850 to 1958. They found that &#x201C;literate conscripts were always taller than illiterate ones (by nearly 1 cm), and agricultural workers, with fewer economic resources, were significantly shorter (by 3.6 cm) than highly qualified non-manual workers&#x201D;.<a id="ref-54" class="ref" href="#note-54"><sup>54</sup></a></p><p>Height inequality, which is measured by the coefficient of variation (CV), is therefore positively correlated with income inequality, which is measured by the Gini coefficient.</p><p>This relationship was observed in a study of Kenya during the 20th century, where the CV mirrored fluctuations in the Gini coefficient. It also compared the height distributions of Uganda and Togo, where average heights were roughly equal, but there was higher income inequality in the former than the latter. Sure enough, the distribution of heights was wider in Uganda.<a id="ref-55" class="ref" href="#note-55"><sup>55</sup></a></p><h3 id="genetics-or-environment-which-contributes-most-to-height-variations-in-a-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#genetics-or-environment-which-contributes-most-to-height-variations-in-a-country"></a>Genetics or environment: which contributes most to height variations in a country?</h3><p>So, both genetic and environmental factors have an impact on height variation. But which is the most important determinant? The relative contribution of genetic factors to differences in heights within populations is defined as &#x2018;heritability&#x2019;. Heritability is measured between 0 and 1; the higher the heritability, the larger the contribution of genetics. Twin and adoption studies typically estimate heritability at about 0.8.<a id="ref-56" class="ref" href="#note-56"><sup>56</sup></a> This means that the majority of the variation in height within a population is due to genetic variation, but environmental variation due to socioeconomic factors also has an impact.</p></section>
















<section><h2 id="data-quality-definition"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definition"></a>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2><p>Accurately measuring the height of an individual is a straightforward task and so we should be confident that there is&#xA0;relatively little measurement error in the recorded data. This is unlikely to be the case when measuring the height of skeletons. What is more, the techniques used to date skeletal remains (such as radio carbon dating) only provide a probabilistic estimate.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the potential sample bias from the historical sources. Since the height data is&#xA0;largely composed of soldiers, criminals, salves and servants, these groups may not be representative of the wider population. This problem has been highlighted by academics researching human height.<a id="ref-57" class="ref" href="#note-57"><sup>57</sup></a> In fact, the observed drop in height during the industrial revolution -- usually attributed to the negative health impacts of industrialisation -- can be explained by the labour market conditions that existed at the time. They argue that &quot;as economies grew, tight labour markets discouraged military enlistments by the most productive workers, with those enlisting (and being measured) increasingly over-representing the less advantaged members of society.&quot;</p><p>By comparing the heights of soldiers in the US army with countries that enforced conscription we can see the bias more clearly.
