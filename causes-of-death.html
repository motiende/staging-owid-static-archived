However, all of the data included in this entry is available to explore at the national level using the &quot;change country&quot; function on the interactive charts.

<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical View</h2><h3 id="causes-of-death-in-recent-decades"><a class="deep-link" href="#causes-of-death-in-recent-decades"></a>Causes of death in recent decades</h3><p>In the chart below we provide a comparison of the number of people which died as a result of specific causes in 2016. This data is given as the total across all ages, and both sexes. Causes of death varies notably between age groups&#xA0;&#x2014; deaths across individual age groupings can be explored in the sections which follow.</p><p>At a global level we see that the majority of deaths are attributed to the category of <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-communicable diseases</a> (NCDs); these are chronic, long-term illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases (including stroke), respiratory disease, cancers and diabetes.&#xA0; Collectively NCDs account for more than 70 percent of global deaths.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/total-number-of-deaths-by-cause" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/total-number-of-deaths-by-cause" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/total-number-of-deaths-by-cause_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/age-standardized-death-rate-by-cause" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://owid.cloud/grapher/age-standardized-death-rate-by-cause" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/age-standardized-death-rate-by-cause_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>Causes of death vary significantly by country and income levels across the world. These deaths are shown in the charts below, which present figures as absolute number of deaths, and as a percentage of total deaths.&#xA0;We also look at the major differences in mortality across the world using country examples in our blog post <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/what-does-the-world-die-from/">here</a>. NCDs not only dominate mortality figures at a global level, but also account for the majority of deaths in high-income countries. Deaths from causes such as infectious disease, malnutrition, nutritional deficiencies, neonatal and maternal deaths in high-income countries is typically very low in relative terms.</p><p>These causes of death are, however, still prevalent (and some cases dominant) across low-to-middle income nations. In Kenya, for example, the leading cause of death remains diarrheal diseases. In South Africa and Botswana, the leading cause of death remains HIV/AIDS.</p><p>Death rates related to disease, illness and other health factors tend to change relatively slowly over time. Whilst death rates may fall or decline from year-to-year as part of a general trend, dramatic changes in such deaths are typically rare. Natural disaster and terrorism-related deaths are an important exception to this rule: mortality from disasters or terrorism/conflict events can be volatile. This can make the annual comparison of deaths and death rates between health-related factors and volatile events more challenging. Understanding the relative risk of these events can require a longer-term overview of high and low-mortality years. We cover discussion and analysis on this topic in a blog post <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/is-it-fair-to-compare-terrorism-and-disaster-with-other-causes-of-death/">here</a>.</p><p>Whilst terrorism-related deaths are typically very low for most countries relative to other mortality causes, in some cases they can be significant. For example, terrorism fatalities were the 6th largest killer in Iraq in 2016. This is well above deaths related to road accidents, respiratory disease and dementia. </p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause_v14_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/share-of-deaths-by-cause-2016_v10_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="why-are-the-number-of-deaths-changing"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-are-the-number-of-deaths-changing"></a>Why are the number of deaths changing?</h3><p>As we see in the charts above&#xA0;&#x2014; whilst death&#xA0;<em>rates</em> are falling globally, the total number of deaths is increasing. What explains this increase in absolute number of deaths?</p><p>In the visualisation below&#xA0;&#x2014; based on figures published by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a>&#xA0;&#x2014; we see the global change in deaths and burden of disease over the past decade (2006 to 2016) disaggregated by contributing factors.</p><p>Population growth and ageing play a significant role in the total increase in number of deaths. If all other factors were kept constant, population growth alone over this period would have resulted in a 12.4 percent in deaths; population ageing alone would have resulted in a 14.9 percent increase.

In 2016, we see there were around 55 million deaths globally; nearly half of these (48%) were in those aged 70 years or older; 27% in the 50-69 year age group; 15% aged 15-49; only 1% aged 5-14; and around 10% in children under the age of 5.</p><p>The demographics of deaths has changed significantly since 1990 with a notable shift from young-to-old. In 1990 nearly one-quarter of all deaths were in children under 5 years old. In 2016, this had declined to just under 10 percent. In contrast, the share of deaths in the over-70s age bracket has increased from 33 percent to 48 percent over this period.</p><p>The distribution of deaths by age varies significantly by country. In Japan, for example, around 83 percent of deaths occur in those aged 70 or older. Deaths in children and adolescents less than 15 years old account for around 0.25 percent of the total.

It includes risk factors across four broad categories:&#xA0;behavioural, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risks.</p><p>We describe further information on how the GBD attributes risk factors to mortality in our <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/causes-of-death#estimating-deaths-attributed-to-risk-factors">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a> section. Note that this process of estimation is not additive; in other words, these risk-specific relationships do not account for the compounding effects of multiple risk factors. High BMI, for example, may likely be present with other lifestyle factors such as low physical activity levels, high blood pressure, low fruit and vegetable intake. All of these estimates are developed independently. We cannot therefore sum all &apos;attributed deaths&apos; and conclude that this is the actual number of deaths. The attributed number of deaths by risk factor in many cases exceeds that of those by cause of death.</p><p>In the chart below we see the number of deaths attributed to specific risk factors in 2016. This data is measured across all age groups and both sexes &#x2014; figures for specific age groups are detailed below. Here we see that there are several dominant risk factors for death: notably, those related to dietary and activity lifestyle factors (including blood pressure, physical activity, body-mass index, blood sugar, and dietary intake); smoking; air pollution (both outdoor and indoor); environmental factors including clean water and sanitation; and safe sex (for the prevention of HIV/AIDS).</p><p>The contribution of specific risk factors varies significantly by country. For most high-income countries, the dominant risk factors are those related to healthy diets, smoking and alcohol intake. Other risk factors such as clean water, sanitation, and child wasting or stunting are very low. In low-income countries the inverse is true: in Sierra Leone for example, the top risk factors include child wasting, household air pollution, unsafe water source, poor sanitation, and no access to handwashing facilities. For countries where HIV/AIDS is a major health burden, such as South Africa and Kenya, unsafe sex is the top risk factor. </p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor_v5_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="risk-factors-of-death-by-age-group"><a class="deep-link" href="#risk-factors-of-death-by-age-group"></a>Risk factors of death by age group</h3><p>In the charts below we see how these risk factors differ between age groups, ranging from children under-5, to those 70+ years old.

In older children and adolescents, environmental factors including water sources, sanitation, handwashing and air pollution become more dominant.

The GBD methodology states that &quot;each death is attributed to a single underlying cause &#x2014; the cause that initiated the series of events leading to death&#x2014;in accordance with ICD principles&quot;. The GBD has developed a comprehensive and in-depth database with regards to mortality and attributed causes, utilising data from various&#xA0; sources. These sources include vital registration (VR); verbal autopsy (VA); surveillance, census and survey data; cancer registries; and police records. GBD then develops a data standardisation and processing methodology within which they define data quality and completeness scores, and where necessary&#xA0;adjust completeness to 100% using cause fractions for a given location-age-sex-year and estimated all-cause mortality for that location-age-sex-year.</p><p>An important step in the GBD methodology standardisation is in reallocating deaths attributed within ICD classifications without an underlying cause of death (for example, senility) which can be intermediate but not final cause of death. These categories are termed as &apos;garbage codes&apos;. GBD redistribute these garbage codes using a methodology explained in detail in Naghavi et al. (2010).<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> Note that this redistributing of &apos;garbage codes&apos; in some cases explains the difference in estimates between IHME and WHO, such as for road accident deaths (compared <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/causes-of-death#road-accidents-ihme-vs-who-statistics">below</a>).</p><p>Death and death rates analyses are then carried out by GBD across locations, age, sex and year based on its&#xA0;Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm). Full description of GBD methodology can be found <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32152-9.pdf">here</a>.</p><h3 id="estimating-deaths-attributed-to-risk-factors"><a class="deep-link" href="#estimating-deaths-attributed-to-risk-factors"></a>Estimating deaths attributed to risk factors</h3><p>Estimating and attributing relative risk factors to number of deaths is a complex task&#xA0;&#x2014; particularly when risk factors can compound and collectively influence the likelihood of disease burden. The IHME&apos;s Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies provide one of, if not the, most in-depth analysis and synthesis of relative risk factors.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> IHME differentiate risk factors into four broad categories:&#xA0;behavioural, environmental, occupational, and metabolic risks.</p><p>IHME have developed a Comparative Risk Assessment (CRA) conceptual framework<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> by which they have built a web of risk factors or causes which affect health outcomes. For example, there is evidence of links between body mass index (BMI) and the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including cardiovascular disease, ischemic stroke and some cancers.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>Such risk-outcome pairs (e.g. high BMI and ischemic stroke) are formed based on evidence links using methods such as cohort studies, randomised trials, and case-control studies. Once a risk-outcome pair has been formed, how does IHME begin to quantify the disease burden or number of deaths attributed to each risk? The CRA can be used for two different types of assessment: <strong>attributable burden</strong> and <strong>avoidable burden</strong>. &apos;Attributable burden&apos; represents the reduction in current disease burden (or that of a given year) if population exposure had shifted to another counterfactual/hypothetical exposure level; &apos;avoidable burden&apos; represents the potential future avoided burden if population exposure was to shift to a counterfactual level of exposure. Since the number of deaths is based on current or historical data, the data presented here is that of&#xA0;<strong>attributable burden</strong>.</p><p>Attributable burden effectively asks the question: &quot;what would the number of deaths from ischemic stroke be if everyone&apos;s body-mass index (BMI) was reduced to a healthy/optimal level (within range)?&quot; This healthy/optimal level is defined as the &apos;<strong>theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL)</strong>&apos;. Cohort, case studies and trials of established risk-exposure relationships between BMI and ischemic stroke allow for the calculation of the reduction in deaths which would have occurred if BMI was reduced to a healthy level across the population distribution. This relationship can be established by specific demographic groups, such as by sex or age. The difference between the number of deaths from ischemic stroke which would have occurred at the TMREL and at the actual BMI distribution is given as the number of deaths attributed to high BMI from ischemic stroke.</p><p>By completing this process for all risk-outcome pairs, IHME can sum to estimate the total number of deaths attributed to high BMI, and replicated for all risk factors using their individual risk-outcome exposure curves. Note that this process of estimation is not additive; in other words, these risk-specific relationships do not account for the compounding effects of multiple risk factors. High BMI, for example, may likely be present with other lifestyle factors such as low physical activity levels, high blood pressure, low fruit and vegetable intake. All of these estimates are developed independently. We cannot therefore sum all &apos;attributed deaths&apos; and conclude that this is the actual number of deaths. The attributed number of deaths by risk factor in many cases exceeds that of those by cause of death.</p><p>Full methodological explanation of the IHME&apos;s approach to risk factor attribution can be found <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32366-8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h3 id="road-deaths-ihme-vs-who-statistics"><a class="deep-link" href="#road-deaths-ihme-vs-who-statistics"></a>Road deaths: IHME vs WHO statistics</h3><p>The data presented on <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/causes-of-death#road-accidents">road mortality</a> in this entry were based on figures published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) programme. It has been widely recognised that IHME data on road accidents tends to be higher than that of official police reports and that reported by the World Health Organization&#xA0;&#x2014; this tends to be the case for OECD countries.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> In the chart below we compare road mortality figures by the IHME (y-axis) and World Health Organization (WHO)<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> (x-axis). Also shown is the line of parity, along which IHME and WHO estimates are the same.</p><p>As we see, there are in some cases notable differences between these estimates, and in particular higher figures for OECD countries for IHME figures. Why does this discrepancy occur? In its own assessment report, IHME highlights this difference, noting that its estimates for OECD countries are on average 58 percent higher than official statistics.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> IHME note that official statistics &quot;&#xA0;typically relies on police reporting, while GBD relies primarily on death registration data in these countries. Furthermore, IRTAD only includes those deaths that occur within the first 30 days of a crash and excludes motor vehicle-related deaths that do not occur in traffic. In contrast, our estimates provide a more comprehensive estimate of the impact of motor vehicles on population health.&quot;</p><p>A notable difference between these sources is the period within which deaths are reported. Official statistics only record that which occurs within 30 days of a crash. GBD data attempts to account for intermediate injuries of health burden which may result in death following a 30 day period. This relates strongly to discussion in our section on <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/causes-of-death#estimating-causes-of-death">&apos;estimating causes of death&apos;</a>&#xA0;where so-called &apos;garbage codes&apos; (which are ICD classifications which can be intermediate but not final cause of death) are assigned to road injuries. In this example, it may be extreme back pain. GBD attempts to redistribute these &apos;garbage codes&apos; to take a more comprehensive estimate of health burden and death which results over a period longer than 30 days.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/road-mortality-rate-comparison" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://owid.cloud/grapher/road-mortality-rate-comparison" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/road-mortality-rate-comparison_v4_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>
