The World Bank definition (which is covered in more detail in our section on <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/water-access-consumption-sanitation/#data-quality-definitions">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a>) of an improved drinking water source includes &quot;piped water on premises (piped household water connection located inside the user&#x2019;s dwelling, plot or yard), and other improved drinking water sources (public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection).&quot; Note that access to drinking water from an improved source does not ensure that the water is safe or adequate, as these characteristics are not tested at the time of survey. But improved drinking water technologies are more likely than those characterized as unimproved to provide safe drinking water and to prevent contact with human excreta. See&#xA0;<a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/water-access-consumption-sanitation/#data-quality-definitions">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a>&#xA0;for more details.</p><p>In 2015, most nations had improved water access in greater than 90 percent of households. This marks significant progress since 1990 where most countries across Latin America, East and South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa were often well below 90 percent. Access remains lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa where rates typically range from 40 to 80 percent of households.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-the-population-with-access-to-improved-drinking-water" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-the-population-with-access-to-improved-drinking-water" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/share-of-the-population-with-access-to-improved-drinking-water_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="share-of-rural-population-with-improved-water-sources"><a class="deep-link" href="#share-of-rural-population-with-improved-water-sources"></a>Share of rural population with improved water sources</h4><p>The share of rural households with improved water sources was lower than the total population in 2015, with 85 percent access. The global distribution of improved water sources in rural populations is shown in the chart below.</p><p>Gaining access to improved water sources can often require infrastructural investment and connection to municipal water networks; this is can be more challenging in rural areas hence we may expect access to be lower. Nonetheless, rural access has risen at a faster rate (based on the relative increase in the share of the population) than total access, increasing by 22 percent since 1990.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/rural-population-with-improved-water" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/rural-population-with-improved-water" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/rural-population-with-improved-water_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="share-of-urban-population-with-improved-water-sources"><a class="deep-link" href="#share-of-urban-population-with-improved-water-sources"></a>Share of urban population with improved water sources</h4><p>The visualisation below shows the share of urban population with access to improved water sources.

The regional breakdown of those without access has changed significantly over the past 25 years.</p><p>In 1990 nearly 42 percent of those without access were in East Asia &amp; the Pacific.

We see that there is a general link between income and freshwater access.</p><p>Typically most countries with greater than 90 percent of households with improved water have an average GDP per capita of more than $10,000-15,000. Those at lower incomes tend to have a larger share of the population without access. However, there are some notable exceptions: for example, more than half of Equatorial Guinea&apos;s population lacks access to improved water despite having an GDP per capita above $27,000. In this case, the country&apos;s wealth is highly concentrated; the mean GDP per capita is therefore far from the median GDP (i.e. there are high levels of inequality). Equatorial Guinea is one of the few <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/political-regime-updated2016">remaining autocracies</a> in the African continent. Its politics and governance therefore has a much stronger influence than average income.</p><p>Although income is an important determinant, the range of levels of access which occur across countries of similar prosperity further support the suggestion that there are other important governance and infrastructural factors which contribute. For example, Malawi has achieved a 90 percent access rate despite having a GDP per capita just over $1,000. Mozambique which has a similar income levels has just over 50 percent access.&#xA0; </p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/improved-water-sources-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/improved-water-sources-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/improved-water-sources-vs-gdp-per-capita_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="urban-rural-gap-in-access-to-improved-water-sources"><a class="deep-link" href="#urban-rural-gap-in-access-to-improved-water-sources"></a>Urban-Rural gap in access to improved water sources</h3><p>In addition to the large inequalities in water access between countries, there are can also be large differences within country. In the chart below we have plotted the share of the urban population with access to improved water sources versus the share in rural areas. Here we have also shown a line of parity; is a country lies along this line then access in rural and urban areas is equal.</p><p>Since nearly all points lie above this line, with very few exceptions&#xA0;&#x2014; notably Palestine&#xA0;&#x2014; access to improved water sources is greater in urban areas relative to rural populations. This may be partly attributed to an income effect; urbanization is a <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/urbanization-vs-gdp">trend strongly related to</a>&#xA0;economic growth.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> The infrastructural challenges of developing municipal water networks in rural areas is also likely to play an important role in lower access levels relative to urbanised populations.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/urban-improved-water-access-vs-rural-water-access" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/urban-improved-water-access-vs-rural-water-access" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/urban-improved-water-access-vs-rural-water-access_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="agricultural-water-withdrawals-tend-to-be-higher-at-low-incomes"><a class="deep-link" href="#agricultural-water-withdrawals-tend-to-be-higher-at-low-incomes"></a>Agricultural water withdrawals tend to be higher at low incomes</h3><p>In the chart below we see agricultural water withdrawals as a share of total water withdrawals versus gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

However, the typical &apos;threshold&apos; for reaching 90-100 percent sanitation provision is notably higher than that of improved water sources.

But improved drinking water technologies are more likely than those characterized as unimproved to provide safe drinking water and to prevent contact with human excreta. While information on access to an improved water source is widely used, it is extremely subjective, and such terms as safe, improved, adequate, and reasonable may have different meanings in different countries despite official WHO definitions. Even in high-income countries treated water may not always be safe to drink. Access to an improved water source is equated with connection to a supply system; it does not take into account variations in the quality and cost (broadly defined) of the service.&quot; <a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p><strong>Improved sanitation facilities</strong>: &quot;An improved sanitation facility is defined as one that hygienically separates human excreta from human contact.&#xA0;They include flush/pour flush (to piped sewer system, septic tank, pit latrine), ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, and composting toilet.</p><p>Improved sanitation facilities range from simple but protected pit latrines to flush toilets with a sewerage connection.

It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It does not include in-stream uses, which are characterized by a very low net consumption rate, such as recreation, navigation, hydropower, inland capture fisheries, etc.&quot;</p><p>Total withdrawal is equal to: [withdrawals for agriculture] + [withdrawals for industry] + [withdrawals for municipal/domestic uses].</p><p>The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) <a href="http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AQUASTAT Database</a>&#xA0;gives the following definitions for agricultural, industrial and municipal withdrawals:</p><p><strong>Agricultural water withdrawal</strong>: &quot;Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for irrigation, livestock and aquaculture purposes. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. Water for the dairy and meat industries and industrial processing of harvested agricultural products is included under industrial water withdrawal.&quot;</p><p><strong>Industrial water withdrawal</strong>: &quot;Annual quantity of self-supplied water withdrawn for industrial uses. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. This sector refers to self-supplied industries not connected to the public distribution network. The ratio between net consumption and withdrawal is estimated at less than 5%. It includes water for the cooling of thermoelectric and nuclear power plants, but it does not include hydropower. Water withdrawn by industries that are connected to the public supply network is generally included in municipal water withdrawal.&quot;</p><p><strong>Municipal water withdrawal</strong>: &quot;Annual quantity of water withdrawn primarily for the direct use by the population. It can include water from primary renewable and secondary freshwater resources, as well as water from over-abstraction of renewable groundwater or withdrawal from fossil groundwater, direct use of agricultural drainage water, direct use of (treated) wastewater, and desalinated water. It is usually computed as the total water withdrawn by the public distribution network. It can include that part of the industries and urban agriculture, which is connected to the municipal network. The ratio between the net consumption and the water withdrawn can vary from 5 to 15% in urban areas and from 10 to 50% in rural areas.&quot;</p><h3 id="data-quality-definitions-water-stress-and-scarcity"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definitions-water-stress-and-scarcity"></a>Water stress and scarcity</h3><p><strong>Renewable internal freshwater resources</strong> refers to the quantity of internal freshwater from inflowing river basins and recharging groundwater aquifers. Data on renewable resources should be treated with caution; since this data is gathered intermittently, it fails to capture seasonal and annual variance in water resources which can be significant in some nations. Data at a national level also fails to capture variability at more local levels, which can be important when analysing the sustainability of particular groundwater aquifers or surface water basins.</p><p><strong>Water stress</strong> is defined in its simplest terms as occurring when&#xA0;water demand or withdrawal substantiates a large share of renewable water resources. The World Resources Institute (WRI) define baseline water stress based on the ratio of annual water withdrawals to renewable resources.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>It defines water stress categories based on this percentage (% of withdrawals to renewable resources) as follows:</p><ul>

<li>10-20% = low-to-medium stress</li>
<li>20-40% = medium-to-high stress</li>
<li>40-80% = high stress</li>
