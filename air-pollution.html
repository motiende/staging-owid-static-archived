by-product of increasing urbanization and industrialization. It does, however, have a long and evolving history with interesting transitions in line with economic, technological and political change. This entry presents a global-level overview of air pollution: trends in emissions from historical through to the present day, the health and mortality burden and risk from air pollution, and discussion of some of the key correlations and determinants of the severity of pollution and its impacts.</p><p>Air pollution occurs in indoor (e.g. household) contexts and outdoor environments&#x2014;this data entry focuses on ambient outdoor pollution. The data entry for indoor pollution can be found <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/indoor-air-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Air pollution can be defined as the emission of harmful substances to the atmosphere. This broad definition therefore encapsulates a number of pollutants, including:</p><ul>
<li>sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>),</li>
<li>nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>),</li>
<li>ozone (O<sub>3</sub>),</li>
<li>particulate matter (small suspended particles of varying sizes),</li>
<li>carbon monoxide (CO)</li>
<li>and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</li>
</ul><p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other greenhouse gases are not typically considered within this category and are <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">treated separately</a> on Our World In Data.</p><p>Disentangling the specific air pollutants&#x2014;and clearly attributing them to a specific health or environmental outcome&#x2014;can be complex since some pollutants act as pre-cursors to others. For example, SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> can react in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere to form particulate matter (PM) compounds. The sources of each pollutant vary, however, most are generally linked to fuel combustion and industrial activities; pollutants are released as by-products of these processes.</p><p>Air pollution has a range of negative impacts, including human health, damage to ecosystems, food crops and the built environment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) highlights air pollution as the greatest environmental risk to human health (note that this is based on current risk- longer-term environmental threats, such as climate change, may exceed this in the future). It&#x2019;s estimated to be the cause of seven million premature deaths every year (4.3 million from ambient outdoor pollution, and 2.6&#xA0;<a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/indoor-air-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from households</a>).<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></section>







<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical View</h2><h3 id="historical-perspective"><a class="deep-link" href="#historical-perspective"></a>Historical Perspective</h3><h4 id="the-long-run-history-when-did-man-made-air-pollution-begin"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-long-run-history-when-did-man-made-air-pollution-begin"></a>The long-run history: When did man-made air pollution begin?</h4><p>Indoor air pollution is caused by the burning of solid fuels in the household &#x2013; for cooking or heating &#x2013; and must have a very long history.</p><p>The use of coal as a source of energy is linked to ambient air pollution. Longer estimates of coal production and imports are available for some of the earliest industrial nations; records of SO<sub>2</sub> and smoke concentrations in London (home to some of the most well-known smog events) have been reconstructed &#xA0;as far back as 1500.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Some anecdotal observations note complaints of air pollution as far back as the 13<sup>th</sup> century. Whilst we therefore associate air pollution with the kick-start of the industrial revolution, we know that the burning of coal at a smaller scale (such as in households)&#x2014;and the resultant SO<sub>2</sub> pollution&#x2014;began much earlier than this.</p><p>Air pollution arises in various forms, providing a number of parameters with which we could measure and track change through time. Long-term historical data on pollution can be difficult to reconstruct or estimate&#x2014;for many pollutants, our global data range is limited to the last few decades.</p><h4 id="how-have-global-emissions-of-so2-evolved"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-have-global-emissions-of-so2-evolved"></a>How have global emissions of SO2 evolved?</h4><p>At the global level, the most extensive historical reconstruction of pollution trends is in sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), which we focus on here.&#xA0;Estimates of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reconstructed in the historical record based on fossil fuel production, imports and industrial processing outputs; such energy production data exists at the national level for most countries dating back to 1850. This is therefore the historical limit for the availability of quantitative information to global and national level emissions.</p><p>Industrialisation marked a key transition point in the magnitude of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result of large-scale burning of sulphur-containing fuels and industrial processing. The visualisation below presents the total global annual emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> by world region, extending from 1850-2010. You can also view SO2 emissions per capita trends by country, <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/so2-emissions-per-capita-tonnes-per-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Europe was first to see a rapid rise in sulphur pollution, followed closely by North America in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century. Driven by the increased energy demand of the industrialisation, emissions in Europe and North America continued to grow through the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>But then the increase of emissions came to an end. In Northern America SO<sub>2</sub> emissions peaked in 1970, in Europe in 1980, and in South America a decade later. Since then emissions have been on a downward trend in these regions. At the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century emissions in Northern America are at a lower level than at any time in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The reason for which we will discuss later.</p><p>With the exception of Japan, industrialisation in Latin America, Asia and Africa began much later. The rise in SO<sub>2 </sub>emissions in the rest of the world was delayed until the 20<sup>th</sup> century. SO<sub>2</sub>, as a by-product of energy and industrial production, is closely linked to <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/economic-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prosperity</a>. So, despite increasing throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, per capita emissions from Asia and Africa were, and still are, small relative to Europe and North America. The dominance of Europe and North America in total global emissions means that the world&#x2019;s SO<sub>2</sub> emissions peaked in the 1980s, despite a continued increase across the other continents.</p><p>Today, the regional trends are split: Annual SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Europe and the Americas continue to fall, while emissions in Asia and Africa are increasing.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/so2-emissions-by-world-region-in-million-tonnes" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/so2-emissions-by-world-region-in-million-tonnes" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/so2-emissions-by-world-region-in-million-tonnes_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="long-term-emissions-in-the-uk-us"><a class="deep-link" href="#long-term-emissions-in-the-uk-us"></a>Long-term emissions in the UK &amp; US</h4><p>The UK&apos;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), publish annual data on air pollutant emissions from human-induced sources, with data trending back to 1970. We see these trends in the charts below.</p><p>The first presents annual emissions of various pollutants indexed to the year 1970 (1980 for ammonia), which is given the value of 100. Values less than 100 therefore indicate a reduction in annual emissions (i.e. a value of 80 would indicate a 20 percent reduction in emissions; a value of 40 would indicate a 60 percent reduction). For all pollutants, with exception of ammonia we see a notable reduction in emissions since 1970.

A &#x2018;death&#x2019; from air pollution <a href="https://www.stateofglobalair.org/data/methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is defined</a> as someone who dies prematurely (could be in the range of months or years) than would be expected in the absence of air pollution. In many cases, air pollution exacerbates pre-existing cardiorespiratory illnesses&#x2014;individuals suffering from asthma, for example, are particularly vulnerable. Researchers link pollution concentrations to health risks using empirical exposure-response relationships and their relation to mortality rates.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Measuring absolute numbers of deaths (which you can explore <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/absolute-number-of-deaths-from-ambient-particulate-air-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) from air pollution presents a number of drawbacks. The first is that&#xA0;the absolute number of deaths as a measure of air pollution is that it takes no account of population size or demographic. We might logically expect the number of deaths to be higher in countries with larger populations, and to increase in line with population growth. Similarly, we might expect the number of deaths to be higher in countries with an older population demographic.</p><p>One metric which corrects for these variables is the age-standardized death rate. This measure reports the number of deaths attributed to air pollution per 100,000 people, and standardizes based on the age structure of the population. It therefore corrects for population size and age demographics (i.e. assumes the same population characteristics across all countries, and through time), allowing for a direct comparison of mortality risk between countries.</p><p>Another drawback to the number of deaths is that it provides no indication of the age of the individuals included in these statistics; for example, a child who dies from an illness related to air pollution is counted exactly the same as an older individual who died a few months earlier than expected. To account for these differences, we also measure morbidity and mortality rates using a metric called &#x2018;Disability-adjusted life years&#x2019; &#xA0;(DALYs) lost. The DALYs lost metric measures the overall loss of healthy life as a result of air pollution, and is given as the sum of the total number of life years lost through premature death and disability. A child who dies from a pollution-related illness will therefore record a higher number of DALYs lost than an older individual.</p><p>Pollution-related disease can be attributed to several different forms of exposure. The three key sources of pollution deaths are from the indoor burning of solid fuels (<a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/indoor-air-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">household pollution</a>), exposure to ambient outdoor ozone (O3), and ambient outdoor particulate matter (PM) pollution. Before looking at the death rates from PM2.5- smaller particles with a diameter of less than 2.5&#xB5;m which&#xA0;can penetrate into the lungs, impacting respiratory health-&#xA0;it&#x2019;s worth having a brief look at how death rates from all three sources have changed through time. In the chart below we see the death rate (per 100,000) from ozone, PM, and indoor pollution. At the global level, we see that the death rate from ozone exposure is small (less than 5%). Rates of PM and indoor pollution exposure are fairly equal (although in 2015, the rate of PM is slightly higher than that of indoor pollution). The relative contribution of the three sources varies between country. Most high-income countries experience negligible impact from indoor fuel use, in contrast to many low- to middle-income countries where household pollution is dominant.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/death-rate-by-source-from-air-pollution-per-100000" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/death-rate-by-source-from-air-pollution-per-100000" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/death-rate-by-source-from-air-pollution-per-100000_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>The chart below focuses on the age-standardized death rate (per 100,000 people) from PM2.5 pollution by country from 1990 to 2015.</p><p>Death rates from air pollution&#x2014;across countries of all income levels&#x2014;have shown a general decline over the last few decades. For many countries, the death rate has declined by more than 50 percent. This reduction trend is true, even in countries with a growing absolute number of deaths&#x2014;China and India, for example. The increase in absolute number of deaths from air pollution is therefore a larger reflection of the changing population structures&#x2014;a growing and aging population&#x2014;rather than an increased individual risk of mortality.</p><p>The decline in death rates in higher-income nations appears to be slowing, however, the risk of mortality from pollution is still markedly lower than most low-to-middle income countries. In 2015, the age-standardized death rate in Australia and New Zealand (the lowest in the world, at 9 per 100,000 people) was nearly fifty times lower than Afghanistan (the highest, at 427 per 100,000 people). In most high-income nations, less than 30 people of every 100,000 died prematurely from ambient air pollution.</p><p>This general reduction in age-standardized death rates is more dramatically reflected in trends in DALY loss rates (per 100,000 people) over time (shown below).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/age-standardised-death-rate-from-ambient-pm25-air-pollution-per-100000" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/age-standardised-death-rate-from-ambient-pm25-air-pollution-per-100000" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/age-standardised-death-rate-from-ambient-pm25-air-pollution-per-100000_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/dalys-particulate-matter" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/dalys-particulate-matter" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/dalys-particulate-matter_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="death-rates-in-2016-vs-1990"><a class="deep-link" href="#death-rates-in-2016-vs-1990"></a>Death rates in 2016 vs. 1990</h3><p>In the chart below we compare the death rates from outdoor particulate matter air pollution in 2016 (y-axis) versus 1990 (x-axis).

Whilst this may have further accelerated its clean-up efforts, I think it&#x2019;s likely that such a transition &#x2013; out of heightened concern for public health &#x2013; would have happened regardless.

This trend is characteristic of what is called the &#x2018;Environmental Kuznets Curve&#x2019; (EKC). The concept of the EKC was first discussed in the 1990s within the 1992 World Development Report, but builds upon the stylized relationship between <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/income-inequality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">income inequality</a> and economic development as described by Simon Kuznets in 1955.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>The EKC provides a hypothesis of the link between environmental degradation and economic development: environmental quality initially worsens with the onset of industrial growth, but then peaks at a certain stage of economic development and from then on environmental quality begins to improve with increased development. Evidence of the EKC is very mixed: across various measures it has been widely contested, but for a number of environmental markers there is strong evidence for the existence of EKC relationship. For example, a recent study published in Science suggests the EKC relationship also appears in links between deforestation, afforestation and economic growth.<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p><p>Do we see this hypothesised trend in SO<sub>2</sub> pollution? It appears we do. Although still controversial<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></span>, a number of studies have found an empirical justification of the EKC link to SO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p>Both Europe and North America went through an initial period of &#x2018;dirty&#x2019; industrialisation whereby sulphur dioxide production increased. However, in the 1970-80&#x2019;s emissions peaked and have since continued to decline.</p><p>This transition was achieved through a number of economic, technological, and policy measures. National regulation and regional policy agreements played a crucial role this clean-up; the first being the <a href="https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/full%20text/1979.CLRTAP.e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution</a> (CLRTAP) signed by 35 countries across North America, Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc. Since then, a number of progressive Sulphur Protocols and <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130822084033/http:/www.defra.gov.uk/industrial-emissions/eu-international/lcpd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European directives</a> have set regulatory limits on SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from large power stations and industrial processes. This has forced the adoption of emissions reduction technologies such as &#x2018;scrubbers&#x2019; which strip the gases of sulphur before being emitted, as well as a migration away from cheaper coal and oil sources which typically have higher sulphur contents.</p><p>However, the EKC links average <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/economic-growth">income</a>, not policy, to environmental quality. Is there therefore a link between higher incomes and better regulatory frameworks? There are three suggested reasons why higher-income nations have stricter regulation: environmental quality achieves a higher priority after basic social demands have been met; richer countries have larger budgets and technical expertise for enforcement and management of regulation; and education-income links provide the necessary levels of local empowerment for enforcement of environmental standards if it&#x2019;s lacking at a national level.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><h3 id="winter-fog-the-link-between-emissions-and-local-concentrations"><a class="deep-link" href="#winter-fog-the-link-between-emissions-and-local-concentrations"></a>Winter fog: the link between emissions and local concentrations</h3><p>Is the level of exposure (i.e. the local concentration) of air pollution directly related to how much emissions we emit locally? To a large extent, yes: typically areas which emit the most also have the highest concentrations of local pollution. However, there is an additional key factor at play, which has some impact on pollution concentrations over time and space: the weather.</p><p>Local weather conditions can influence pollution concentrations in a number of ways<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a>:</p><ul>
<li>winds can transport air pollutants from the region&#xA0;of emission to surrounding areas (so, on windy days, a region with low emission levels could be exposed to higher levels of pollution, if carried in from elsewhere);</li>
<li>&#xA0;the opposite is true for high-emission areas- on still days, local pollutants can get trapped at ground-level&#xA0;with minimal air flow to distribute it elsewhere;</li>
<li>during cold spells a layer of cool air can get trapped at ground-level, preventing local pollutants from dispersing higher in the atmosphere. In most cases, air quality issues are therefore worse during winter months. Note also that during cold spells, the burning of fossil fuels for heating purposes also rises- adding to the problem.</li>
<li>the exception to this general trend is the case of ozone (O3). Ozone is formed through the reaction of other pollutants (NOx) in sunlight. Ozone concentrations are therefore highest in spring and summer, during still and sunny conditions.</li>
</ul><p>So, whilst the level of emissions is the key determinant of local pollution concentrations, seasonal and weather patterns have an important influence on the year-round fluctuations in exposure levels.</p><h3 id="explaining-death-rates-from-air-pollution"><a class="deep-link" href="#explaining-death-rates-from-air-pollution"></a>Explaining death rates from air pollution</h3><p>A key driver in addressing air pollution issues is the burden it has on human health. What determines the likelihood that a given individual will die prematurely from pollution-related illness? The concentration of local pollutants (i.e. the exposure) seems like an obvious correlate, but are there other factors at play? Below we see the death rate (age-standardized, per 100,000 people) from PM2.5 pollution (on the y-axis) against PM2.5 concentrations (on the x-axis) in 2015. The size of bubbles indicate GDP per capita (i.e. average prosperity), and bubbles are coloured by continent.</p><p>Indeed, we see some important correlations. In general terms, the death rate from air pollution is higher in countries that have a higher level of pollution. There is also an important regional divide: most European, North American and Latin American countries cluster near the origin at low pollution levels and low death rates. Nearly all countries with either a high death rate or high PM2.5 concentration (or both) are in Africa or&#xA0;Asia.</p><p>But what about some of the outliers on this correlation? How do some countries with a high level of PM2.5 pollution managed to maintain a notably lower death rate? Countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, and the UAE have a comparably lower risk of premature death, despite high levels of pollution. They do, however, have a significantly higher GDP per capita than their neighbours (as evidenced by bubble size). It may therefore be expected that overall health, wellbeing and healthcare/medical standards in these nations significantly reduce the risk of mortality from respiratory illness. The influence of GDP and quality of life is also likely to explain the other extreme, where countries such as Afghanistan and the Central African Republic have a very high death rate, despite having mid-range pollution levels. With low GDP levels, overall health and healthcare quality is likely to increase the burden of pollution-related disease.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>The importance of overall developmental indicators (such as quality of life, health and healthcare) also allows us to explain why the death rates from PM2.5 pollution have fallen in most countries since 1990. The reduction in death rates through time cannot be attributed to a reduction in pollution levels for a number of countries (in China and India, for example, death rates have fallen despite large increases in PM2.5 concentrations). This reduced risk of mortality must therefore be explained by external factors which improve overall health outcomes and vulnerability.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/death-rate-from-pm25-vs-pm25-concentration-by-country" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/death-rate-from-pm25-vs-pm25-concentration-by-country" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/death-rate-from-pm25-vs-pm25-concentration-by-country_v8_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="richer-countries-tend-to-have-lower-death-rates-from-air-pollution"><a class="deep-link" href="#richer-countries-tend-to-have-lower-death-rates-from-air-pollution"></a>Richer countries tend to have lower death rates from air pollution</h3><p>In the chart below we see the relationship between death rates from outdoor air pollution and average income (here measured as gross domestic product per capita).

Most of the world&apos;s richest countries have death rates in the range of 10 to 20 per 100,000; at middle incomes this tends to span anywhere from 30 to 120 per 100,000; and at lower incomes this can extend up to 150 (or more than 200 in the case of Afghanistan) per 100,000.</p><p>The span of death rates for any given level of income, however, also indicates that local contexts, policies, urban and transport systems, and healthcare can also have a substantial impact on air pollution death rates.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/deaths-air-pollution-vs-gdp" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/deaths-air-pollution-vs-gdp" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/deaths-air-pollution-vs-gdp_v3_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="explaining-the-number-of-deaths-from-air-pollution"><a class="deep-link" href="#explaining-the-number-of-deaths-from-air-pollution"></a>Explaining the number of deaths from air pollution</h3><p>If the death rate across many countries is falling, why are the absolute number of deaths increasing? The absolute number of deaths is a function of three variable: the death rate, the population size, and the age demographic of the populace. If two countries have the same death rate, the country with the larger population, or older population will have the largest absolute number of deaths.</p><p>This has obvious implications for countries with a growing population. If the&#xA0;rate of population growth outpaces the reduction in death rates, then the absolute number of deaths will continue to grow (despite the risk of mortality for a given individual falling).</p></section>

Historical SO<sub>2</sub> emissions are therefore reconstructed based on energy production, industrial output and fuel import records. Since SO<sub>2</sub> is emitted primarily from the burning of fuels, we can estimate emissions in a given year from the scale of energy production, fuel source and general quality of fuel (some fuels will contain more sulphur than others, leading to higher SO2 emissions when combusted).</p><p>The methodology used by data sources referenced in this entry can be found in full detail&#xA0;in:</p><p>Smith, S. J., van Aardenne, J., Klimont, Z., Andres, R. J., Volke, A., and Delgado Arias, S. (2011): Anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions: 1850&#x2013;2005, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 11, 1101-1116, <a href="http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/11/1101/2011/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doi:10.5194/acp-11-1101-2011.</a></p><h3 id="how-do-we-measure-more-recent-particulate-matter-pm-and-ozone-o3-trends"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-we-measure-more-recent-particulate-matter-pm-and-ozone-o3-trends"></a>How do we measure more recent Particulate Matter (PM) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)&#xA0;trends?</h3><p>Most high-income countries have fairly well-developed air quality monitoring and reporting networks at the ground-level- these generally provide consistent hourly readings of air quality. These measurements are, however, often limited to major city centres.</p><p>Many low- and middle-income countries lack sufficient data coverage altogether. To provide an extensive and consistent view of air pollution levels across a given country, and for global comparison, we therefore have to rely on additional methods of measurement. Data is therefore collected through a combination of satellite observations, global air transport models, local meteorological conditions, and local ground measurements where available. Exposure to PM2.5 and O<sub>3</sub> is then calculated across grid cells of 0.1 x 0.1 degrees longitude and latitude (11km x 11km at the equator). With data on population density within each grid cell, we can then calculate the population-weighted average exposure of the population of a given country.</p><p>In the case of ozone, meteorological data is used to report a seasonal average concentration for summer (when concentrations are highest).</p><h3 id="how-do-we-estimate-the-number-of-deaths-and-dalys-lost-from-air-pollution"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-we-estimate-the-number-of-deaths-and-dalys-lost-from-air-pollution"></a>How do we estimate the number of deaths and DALYs lost from air pollution?</h3><p>It&#x2019;s important to emphasize the difficulties in directly attributing deaths to air pollution. A &#x2018;death&#x2019; from air pollution <a href="https://www.stateofglobalair.org/data/methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is defined</a> as someone who dies prematurely (could be in the range of months or years) than would be expected in the absence of air pollution. In many cases, air pollution exacerbates pre-existing cardiorespiratory illnesses&#x2014;individuals suffering from asthma, for example, are particularly vulnerable. We link pollution concentrations to health risks using empirical exposure-response relationships and their relation to mortality rates.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p>Absolute number of deaths gives no indication of the age at which an individual died prematurely. For this, we use a measure of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost. DALYs lost provide an overall measure of the loss of healthy life expectancy and are calculated as the sum of the healthy years of life lost from a premature death linked to a pollution-related illness, and the years lived with disability caused by the attributable&#xA0;disease attributable to air pollution. The DALYs of a child who suffered mortality from a pollution-related illness will be significantly higher than an older individual.</p><h3 id="how-do-we-estimate-the-death-and-daly-loss-rate-from-air-pollution"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-we-estimate-the-death-and-daly-loss-rate-from-air-pollution"></a>How do we estimate the death and DALY loss&#xA0;<em>rate</em>&#xA0;from air pollution?</h3><p>The death and DALY loss rate of air pollution is measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 people. This is calculated based on a country&apos;s population size for a given year.</p><h3 id="why-do-we-need-age-standardized-death-rates"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-do-we-need-age-standardized-death-rates"></a>Why do we need age-standardized death rates?</h3><p>Death and DALY loss rates are reported as age-standardized figures to allow for a fair cross-comparison of mortality and morbidity risk between countries and through time. Age-standardization normalises death rates to a set population structure (population size and age) to cancel out variation which would occur between countries based on population demographics. If rates were not age-standardized, a country with a larger or older population would report higher death rates than a smaller or younger country, even if levels of pollution exposure were the same.</p></section>
