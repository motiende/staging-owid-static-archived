In James Flynn&apos;s book <em>What Is Intelligence?: Beyond the Flynn Effect</em>, he decomposes the gains in IQ found for American children in the Weschsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and finds that much of the gains have come from tests of abstract thinking (similarities test and Raven&apos;s progressive matrices). Only a small portion of the gains is due to improvements in information, arithmetic and vocabulary. This observation would support the idea that increases in IQ have been driven by the changing way in which we live.</p><h6>WISC IQ gains for America, 1947-2002&#xA0;&#x2013; Flynn (2007)<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_wisc-iq-gains-over-time-flynn-2007.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5746" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_wisc-iq-gains-over-time-flynn-2007-729x550.png" alt="WISC IQ Gains over time - Flynn (2007)" width="729" height="550"></a></p><h3 id="alexander-luria-s-studies-of-reasoning"><a class="deep-link" href="#alexander-luria-s-studies-of-reasoning"></a>Alexander Luria&apos;s Studies of Reasoning</h3><p>Alexander Luria, a Russian neuropsychologist, conducted a series of interviews with headmen of villages in rural 1920s Russia as part of a study of reasoning. His research was published in a book titled <em>Cognitive Development: Its Cultural and Social Foundations</em> in 1976. The following extract from James Flynn&apos;s <em>What is intelligence?</em> is just one example of the types of responses Luria received from the villagers.</p><blockquote><p>Today we have no difficulty freeing logic from concrete referents and reasoning about purely hypothetical situations. People were not always thus. Christopher Hallpike (1979) and Nick Mackintosh (2006) have drawn my attention to the seminal book on the social foundations of cognitive development by Luria (1976). His interviews with peasants in remote areas of the Soviet Union offer some wonderful examples. The dialogues paraphrased run as follows:</p>
<p>White bears and Novaya Zemlya (pp. 108-109):</p>
<p>Q: All bears are white where there is always snow; in Zovaya Zemlya there is always snow; what color are the bears there?</p>
<p>A: I have seen only black bears and I do not talk of what I have not seen.</p>
<p>Q: But what do my words imply?</p>
<p>A: If a person has not been there he can not say anything on the basis of words. If a man was 60 or 80 and had seen a white bear there and told me about it, he could be believed.</p></blockquote><h3 id="population-aging-and-the-flynn-effect"><a class="deep-link" href="#population-aging-and-the-flynn-effect"></a>Population Aging and The Flynn Effect</h3><p>The effect of an aging population, especially in advanced economies, has an attenuating effect on average cognitive abilities over time. Skirbekk et al. writing in <em>Intelligence</em> create projections of future cognitive abilities and find that if the Flynn effect reaches a saturation point, then average cognitive ability declines into the future. However, if the current Flynn effect persists, average intelligence will continue to rise in spite of an aging population. Consider the following simulations.</p><h6>Cognitive score in scenario with no cohort effect and constant age variation, 2002-2042 &#x2013;&#xA0;Skirbekk et al.

</h6><h3 id="nutrition-and-prosperity-evidence-from-aberdeen"><a class="deep-link" href="#nutrition-and-prosperity-evidence-from-aberdeen"></a>Nutrition and Prosperity: Evidence from Aberdeen</h3><p>An examination of the differences in IQ between two cohorts, one group born in 1921 and the other 15 years apart in 1936, finds substantial differences in IQ over their lifetimes. The study conducted by Staff et al. uses panel (longitudinal) data on the same groups of individuals.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> All students born in either 1921 or 1936 and attending school in Scotland on June 1, 1932 or June 4, 1947 were made to sit intelligence examinations. The authors report that scores on the Raven&apos;s Progressive Matrices (RPM) test decreases annually by over one-half point. At age 77 (where there is an overlap in data) there is an estimated difference of 16.5 IQ points between the two cohorts, which is roughly three times larger than expected.</p><p>Dr Roger Staff explains that &quot;those born in 1936 were children during the war and experienced food rationing. Although rationing meant that the food was not particularly appetising it was nutritious and probably superior to the older group. In addition, post-war political changes such as the introduction of the welfare state and a greater emphasis on education probably ensured better health and greater opportunities. Finally, in their thirties and forties the 1936 group experienced the oil boom which brought them and the city prosperity. Taken together, good nutrition, education and occupational opportunities have resulted in this life long improvement in their intelligence. Aberdeen has been good for their IQ!&quot; More information on this research can be found <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/6970/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h3 id="genetics-and-intelligence"><a class="deep-link" href="#genetics-and-intelligence"></a>Genetics and Intelligence</h3><p>The influence of genetics in determining intelligence is both an immensely important and controversial question. The main reason for the controversy surrounding this question is the connection between race, genetics and intelligence, as well as the policy implications for development and equality. Whilst there exists a broad consensus that intelligence is jointly pinned down by genetics and environmental factors, the precise mixture is uncertain.</p><p>In 1994 Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray published <em>The Bell Curve</em>, a highly controversial book on intelligence that explored the race gap in IQ that exists in the United States. The authors&apos; belief that IQ is mostly inherited leads them to the following policy recommendations to prevent a decline in national intelligence:</p><ul>
<li>The US government should eliminate any welfare incentives for poor (low-IQ) women to have children, since richer (high-IQ) couples have less children.</li>
<li>Funding for educational programmes aimed at raising the achievement of poor and disadvantaged students should be stopped.</li>
<li>Reducing immigration into the US.</li>
<li>The removal of affirmative action programmes as under-representation of particular racial groups is a reflection of ability and intelligence.</li>
</ul><p>The major flaws in the research of Hernstein and Murray rest with their assertions about intelligence, in particular, that intelligence is mostly inherited and therefore invariant to time and environment. This central belief would generate a causal relationship between IQ and socioeconomic indicators such as high school dropout, incarceration, and poverty.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> Research looking into the effects of environment on intelligence expose serious short-comings in the arguments and conclusions of <em>The Bell Curve</em>. Turkheimer et al. (2003) find that the relative importance of genetics and environment in the IQ of genetically identical twins is linked to socioeconomic status.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a> They report that &quot;in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in IQ is accounted for by the shared environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse.&quot;</p><h3 id="global-differences-in-iq"><a class="deep-link" href="#global-differences-in-iq"></a>Global Differences in IQ</h3><p>International comparisons of IQ measures reveal large disparities between developed and developing countries. Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen&apos;s controversial research explores this area.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> Lynn and Vanhanen subscribe to the view that IQ is mainly inherited and argue that the lower IQ of these nations is what holds back development. To support this claim they make use of the correlations between standard of living measures and IQ. This conclusion rests on the direction of causality; if low economic development has held back the Flynn effect and prevented intelligence growth, the results of the study are flawed.</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_average-iq-by-country-v2.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5780 size-large" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_average-iq-by-country-v2-750x455.png" alt="" width="750" height="455"></a></p><p>The methodology of their research has been heavily criticized for not having consistent measures of IQ across countries and for the way estimates were generated. For example, the average IQ of countries without data is reported as the average of neighboring or comparable countries. In addition to this, the way in which samples were either included or excluded in their analysis is unsystematic, potentially biasing their results. Thomas Nechyba&apos;s review in the <em>Journal of Economic Literature</em> points out the following flaw:<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><blockquote><p>The degree of IQ heritability, however, has no logical bearing on this issue. Even if we take the authors&#x2019; reading of the literature as given and assume that 80 percent of IQ is heritable, the entire observed cross country difference in IQ may be environmentally rather than genetically&#xA0;driven. Consider, for instance, a plant variety whose size is known to be 80 percent heritable. If we grow genetically identical seeds of this plant in two plots under the same initial soil conditions and then fertilize only one plot, the dramatic differences in plant height that emerge will be entirely driven by environmental factors despite the high heritability of plant height. The fact that some countries score lower on IQ tests than others thus has nothing to say about the degree to which IQ scores are genetically predetermined or the degree to which they will change under different circumstances. Developed countries may simply be like the plants that received fertilizer earlier for reasons having nothing to do with IQ.</p></blockquote></section>
