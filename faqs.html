We know &#x2013; <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/owid-for-teaching-feedback">based on surveys from users</a> &#x2013; that many teachers do use our work.

<li><strong>Specialized institutes</strong> &#x2013; like the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO)</li>
<li><strong>Research articles</strong> &#x2013; like Bourguignon &amp; Morrison (2002) &#x2013; &#x2019;Inequality Among World Citizens: 1820-1992&#x2019; in the American Economic Review.</li>
<li><strong>International institutions or statistical agencies</strong> &#x2013; like the OECD, the World Bank, and UN institutions.</li>
</ol><p>In every visualization we indicate clearly the source of the presented data. Where we have combined data sources or made changes to original datasets (such as regional aggregations), this is also indicated.</p><h3 id="how-do-you-decide-what-data-sources-to-use"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-you-decide-what-data-sources-to-use"></a>How do you decide what data sources to use?</h3><p>We have six guidelines to decide which sources to accept and which data to present.</p><p><strong>1) As far back into the past as possible &#x2013; but up to today</strong></p><p>The goal is to give a perspective on the long-term development and therefore we always aim to find time series data that reach back as far as possible. Unfortunately the availability of data is often itself an achievement of modern development and data is not available for the more distant past. A solution for this problem is data that has later been reconstructed and we aim to give a more complete picture by taking this data into account.</p><p>At the same time the idea is also to present a &apos;history of today&apos; and we therefore also want to ensure that the data presented reaches until today. The limitation here is often that it takes up to several years for researchers and international institutions to publish important data for the most recent period.</p><p><strong>2) As global as possible</strong></p><p>A second objective is to give an account of each topic that includes as many societies, countries, and world regions as possible.</p><p><strong>3) Present data in its entirety</strong></p><p>Shorter sample periods may mask important trends and a recent reversal of a long-term trend could be falsely interpreted as the direction of the long-term trend. The merit of taking a historical perspective that studies long-term trends is that it shows the direction in which some aspect of our world is developing. Therefore we also always ensure to present the whole dataset and we do not want to cut off the original data.</p><p><strong>4) Comparable through time and across societies</strong></p><p>A third objective is to ensure that the data we present is comparable across time and across societies.</p><p>When data is not comparable across countries and through time we highlight this in the text accompanying the visualisation.</p><p><strong>5) There is no other data - or we would include this data</strong></p><p>An important promise is that we are not withholding any data that would give a different impression of the long-term development of some aspect. If two credible sources would publish statistics that contradict each other &#x2013; indicating an open debate between researchers &#x2013; then we would say so.</p><p><strong>6) Reference the original source</strong></p><p>To make the database useful for readers and credit the important work of those who construct the data presented here we aim to always reference the original source of the data.</p><p>We take great care to follow these guidelines. Unintentional mistakes or omissions, whilst hopefully rare, are of course possible. If you find any instance where we have not followed these guidelines, or you have any other complaints, please do get in touch at info@ourworldindata.org or through our <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/feedback">Feedback</a> page.</p><h3 id="how-do-you-decide-which-topics-to-cover"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-you-decide-which-topics-to-cover"></a>How do you decide which topics to cover?</h3><p>We have a list of all the topics we want to cover and have been working through this list for several years now. Our goal here is to cover all quantifiable aspects that matter for our living conditions and the earth&#x2019;s environment.</p><p>In deciding which topics to cover next we take several aspects into account:</p><ol>
<li>Do we have someone in the team or can we collaborate with someone who is an expert on the topic?</li>
<li>We tend to give priority to topics that are not covered well in other publications. For instance we cover plastic pollution and air pollution extensively, but have less content on the consequences of climate change. This does not reflect our view of the relative importance of these topics, but rather of where we think our work can be the most useful in filling gaps in other publications.</li>
<li>Another consideration is whether we have funding to work on a particular topic. Research grants that go to the University of Oxford where the researchers are based are grants to work on specific topics. We have a lot of freedom thankfully to work on those topics that are most important, but we cannot use funding we have to work on economic inequality to work on historical analysis of agriculture. Because we receive donations from readers this constraint is not limiting us currently so that aspects 1 and 2 are most important in practice.</li>
</ol><h3 id="do-you-only-cover-positive-trends-and-stories-of-progress"><a class="deep-link" href="#do-you-only-cover-positive-trends-and-stories-of-progress"></a>Do you only cover positive trends and stories of progress?</h3><p>We are interested in the state of the world and how it changed. Many of the trends that we discuss in our articles are positive; and since fewer people are aware of these positive developments, these trends often get considerable attention from our audience. But it&#x2019;s not that we have an editorial agenda to only study positive trends. Indeed, in our publication you will also find very worrying trends: <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/global-economic-inequality#global-income-inequality-is-still-very-high-and-will-stay-very-high-for-a-long-time">inequality</a> is rising in many countries, <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/global-economic-inequality#inequality-within-countries-and-inequality-between-countries">obesity</a> is rising in all world regions, <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">CO2 emissions</a> have increased for many decades while they need to fall urgently).</p><p>Additionally, we are convinced that covering positive trends is not in conflict with acknowledging <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/much-better-awful-can-be-better">just how awful</a> the world continues to be in many ways, for many people. In fact the opposite is true: charting the progress of the past helps us see just how much better the world could be in the future, if we make this our goal.</p><p>Consider a concrete example. <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/extreme-poverty#the-number-of-people-in-poverty-over-the-past-two-centuries">Every tenth person</a> in the world today lives in extreme poverty. That statistic summarises a degree of suffering that is barely comprehensible. But the fact that, since 2000, there are a billion fewer people living beneath this very low poverty line shows us that ending extreme poverty is possible, if we choose to make it happen. This is the very reason we write about extreme poverty.</p><h3 id="how-where-is-your-work-used"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-where-is-your-work-used"></a>How/where is your work used?</h3><p>You can read about our audience and some of the different ways people use our work <a href="/coverage">here</a>.</p><h3 id="how-are-you-funded"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-are-you-funded"></a>How are you funded?</h3><p>We are funded through grants and reader donations.</p><p>Reader donations are essential to our work, providing us with the stability and independence we need, so we can focus on showing the data and evidence we think everyone needs to know.</p><p>You can learn more about our supporters <a href="/supporters">here.
