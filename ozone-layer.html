In this entry we present the data on ozone layer depletion, signs of recovery, emissions of ozone-depleting substances, international agreement and collaboration, and the consequences of ozone layer depletion.</p><p>Here is an overview of some of the key points we cover below:</p><ul>
<li>Global emissions of ozone-depleting substances have declined by more than 98 percent since 1986 (the year before international action was agreed) [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#ozone-depleting-emissions">jump to section</a>]</li>
<li>The Montreal Protocol (and later amendments) was adopted in 1987&#xA0;&#x2014; since then all countries have signed on to the agreement, allowing for the dramatic decline in global ozone-depleting emissions [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#international-agreements">jump to section</a>]</li>
<li>Ozone layer thickness declined, and the Antarctic ozone hole grew substantially from the 1980s through to the early 2000s. Through the first decade this trend largely stabilised and we now see initial signs of recovery [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#ozone-layer-depletion">jump to section</a>]</li>
<li>Ozone layer depletion increases the amount of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation that reaches Earth&apos;s surface; this can increase the risk of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cancer">skin cancer</a>, particularly at higher latitudes [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#impacts-on-uv-irradiation">jump to section</a>]</li>

<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical View</h2><h3 id="why-is-the-ozone-layer-important"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-is-the-ozone-layer-important"></a>Why is the ozone layer important?</h3><h4 id="what-is-ozone"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-ozone"></a>What is ozone?</h4><p>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a gas which is present naturally within Earth&apos;s atmosphere. It is formed of three oxygen atoms (giving it the chemical formula, O<sub>3</sub>). Its structure means that it&apos;s much less stable than oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and is therefore much more reactive; this means it can be more easily formed and broken down through interaction with other compounds.</p><p>This reactivity is significant in its interactions described <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#what-are-ozone-depleting-substances">in the entry below</a>: the ozone layer can be depleted and broken down through its interaction with man-made compounds in the upper atmosphere.</p><h4 id="ozone-and-its-impact-through-the-atmosphere"><a class="deep-link" href="#ozone-and-its-impact-through-the-atmosphere"></a>Ozone and its impact through the atmosphere</h4><p>To understand the importance of the ozone layer, it&apos;s crucial to first establish the difference in concentrations of ozone throughout the Earth&apos;s atmosphere.</p><p>In the figure below we see a standard profile of ozone gas concentration through the Earth&apos;s atmosphere, extending from ground level up to 40 kilometres in altitude. Ozone plays a different role in atmospheric chemistry at different heights in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. We can differentiate this profile into two key zones:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Tropospheric ozone </strong>is that which is present in the lower atmosphere (the troposphere; with a height of 5km to 15km depending on your latitude). Throughout most of the troposphere, ozone concentrations are relatively low (as shown in the diagram below). However, concentrations of ozone can be higher very close to the surface at local levels; there it forms as an air pollutant and can negatively impact on human health.Ground-level ozone can form through chemical reactions between local air pollutants such as nitrous oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and sunlight. These air pollutants are emitted from motor vehicle exhausts, industrial processes, electric utilities, and chemical solvents. Ground-level ozone can have <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution#death-rates-from-air-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative impacts on human health</a>; breathing ozone is particularly harmful for the young, elderly and people with underlying respiratory problems. It is therefore commonly referred to as &apos;bad&apos; ozone.</li>
<li><strong>Stratospheric ozone</strong> is that which is present in the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere; typically extending from around 10 to 15km up to 50km depending on latitude). As shown in the diagram below, concentrations of ozone are higher in the stratosphere than in the troposphere. The stratosphere includes the zone termed the &apos;ozone layer&apos;.Ozone in the stratosphere plays a very different role to that in the layer below. In the ozone layer, it is often referred to as &apos;good&apos; ozone since it plays a crucial role in absorbing potentially dangerous ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation from the sun. The ozone layer typically absorbs 97-99 percent of incoming UV-B radiation. Higher concentrations of ozone in the stratosphere is therefore crucial to ensure life (including humans) at Earth&apos;s surface are not exposed to harmful concentrations of UV-B radiation.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The focus of this entry will be on the &apos;ozone layer&apos;&#xA0;&#x2014; the ozone that exists within the stratosphere. The impact of ozone in the troposphere (as a local air pollutant) is instead covered in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entry on Air Pollution</a>.</strong></p><p><a href="/uploads/2018/06/Ozone-zones-in-atmosphere-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19363" src="/uploads/2018/06/Ozone-zones-in-atmosphere-01.png" alt="" width="695" height="664"></a></p><h4 id="what-are-ozone-depleting-substances"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-are-ozone-depleting-substances"></a>What are ozone-depleting substances?</h4><p>Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are halogen gases containing chlorine and/or bromine which have the potential to break down ozone in the stratosphere. There are a significant number of ODS, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), methyl chloride and bromide, and halons.</p><p>These gases, emitted at the surface, are distributed globally through the lower atmosphere through wind transport patterns. From there, they can be transported into the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) where they can form highly reactive chlorine or bromine gases in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) sunlight. Reactive halogen gases can then destroy stratospheric ozone, resulting in depletion of the ozone layer.</p><p>Individual ozone-depleting substances are not equal in their impact on depletion. Some gases, per tonne, have a significantly higher potential for ozone depletion than others. In our section on Data Quality &amp; Definitions, we <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#ozone-depleting-substances">provide a table</a> of ODS and their respective &apos;ozone depleting potential&apos; (ODP). ODP measures the relative impact on ozone depletion per tonne of gas. An ODP of 10, for example, is ten times as effective in depleting ozone per tonne, than an ODP of 1.</p><h3 id="emissions-of-ozone-depleting-substances"><a class="deep-link" href="#emissions-of-ozone-depleting-substances"></a>Emissions of ozone-depleting substances</h3><h4 id="total-emissions-of-ozone-depleting-substances"><a class="deep-link" href="#total-emissions-of-ozone-depleting-substances"></a>Total emissions of ozone-depleting substances</h4><p>Ozone-depleting substances (chlorines and bromines) can be emitted from natural and anthropogenic (man-made) sources. In the chart below we see emissions of ozone-depleting substances from 1960 onwards. This is measured in tonnes of chlorofluorocarbon-11-equivalents (CFC<sub>11</sub> equivalents). CFC<sub>11</sub> equivalents is a standardized measure to normalise the sum of a range of ozone-depleting substances to a value equivalent to their potential to deplete ozone; as we describe in our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#units-of-ozone-depleting-substance-emissions">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a> section, depleting substances are weighted by their potential to destroy ozone.</p><p>Shown in the chart below is the level of natural emissions (which has been approximately consistent over this period), and total emissions which is the sum of natural and man-made emissions. Here we see a clear growth-peak-reduction trend in ozone-depleting emissions, with a rapid rise in emissions (increasing more than three-fold) from 1960 through to the late 1980s, followed by a similarly fast reduction in the decades which followed. By 2010, emissions had returned to 1960 levels. This was largely the result of international regulatory agreements and concerted action to phase-out the production and consumption of these substances (explored <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#the-montreal-protocol">later in this entry</a>).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ozone-depleting-substance-emissions" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ozone-depleting-substance-emissions" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/ozone-depleting-substance-emissions_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="production-consumption-of-ozone-depleting-substances"><a class="deep-link" href="#production-consumption-of-ozone-depleting-substances"></a>Production/consumption of ozone-depleting substances</h3><p>In the section above we provide data on global emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Emissions do not necessarily equate to production/consumption of these materials; in our section on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#emissions-vs-production-vs-concentration">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a> we explain the distinction between these two measures.</p><p>In the chart below we see the magnitude of global decline in ODS <em>consumption</em> since 1986. This data measures the indexed consumption of ODS to the 1986 (i.e. levels in 1986 are equal to 100). Following a 28% rise in 1987, we see a rapid consumption in global emissions. Consumption fell by more than 60 percent by 1995; 80 percent by 2000; and by 98-99 percent by 2016.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ozone-depleting-substances-index" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ozone-depleting-substances-index" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/ozone-depleting-substances-index_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="ods-consumption-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#ods-consumption-by-country"></a>ODS consumption by country</h4><p>In the chart below we see the quantity of ODS consumption by country. This is measured in tonnes of ozone-depleting substances all weighted relative to their depleting potential.</p><p>Using the &apos;play&apos; button on the map below allows you to view changes across the world since 1989. By clicking on a country on the map, you can view a time-series of how its national consumption has changed over this period.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/consumption-of-ozone-depleting-substances" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/consumption-of-ozone-depleting-substances" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/consumption-of-ozone-depleting-substances_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="production-consumption-by-substance"><a class="deep-link" href="#production-consumption-by-substance"></a>Production/consumption by substance</h4><p>The trends in consumption above have been aggregated to total consumption of ODS. This quantifies the aggregate of a number of substances. In the chart below we see the breakdown of consumption by substance. Note that, as with other measures throughout this entry, each substance has been weighted by its potential to destroy ozone.</p><p>By using the &quot;change country&quot; button in the interactive chart you can view consumption patterns of individual substances by country or region. By checking the &apos;relative&apos; box you can also view percentage share of a given substance to total ODS consumption.</p><p>At the global level we see the trend of declining consumption &#x2014; as established above&#xA0;&#x2014; since 1989. However, it&apos;s also interesting to note the relative decline and change in the quantity of individual substances. Throughout the 1990s and first half of the 2000s, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) dominated global consumption (accounting for 60 percent, reducing to 50 percent). However, through the 2000s we have seen a rising dominance of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs); in 2014 HCFCs accounted for 94 percent of global consumption.</p><p>This transition reflects the substitution of CFCs with HCFCs in order to reducing total ozone depletion. When we compare the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#ozone-depleting-substances">ozone-depleting potential (ODP)</a> of CFCs and HCFCs we see that the depleting potential of one tonne or HCFCs is 10 to 100 times less than that of one tonne of CFCs. This replacement was therefore been an important reduction strategy (particularly where the complete phase-out of ozone depleting substances was not readily available).</p><p>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have almost been completely phased out, declining from over 800,000 tonnes in 1989 to 156 tonnes in 2014.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ozone-depleting-substance-consumption" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ozone-depleting-substance-consumption" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/ozone-depleting-substance-consumption_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="international-agreements"><a class="deep-link" href="#international-agreements"></a>International agreements</h3><h4 id="vienna-convention-for-the-protection-of-the-ozone-layer"><a class="deep-link" href="#vienna-convention-for-the-protection-of-the-ozone-layer"></a>Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer</h4><p>The rapid decline in emissions of ozone-depleting substances <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#man-made-production-consumption-of-ozone-depleting-substances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown above</a>&#xA0;was driven by international agreement to phase out their production. In 1985 the <em>Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer</em> was adopted and entered into force in 1988.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>In the chart below we see the evolution of global parties signing on to the Vienna Convention.

This rapidly increased in the years to follow, reaching 174 parties by 2000.&#xA0;In 2009, the Vienna Convention became the first of any Convention to achieve universal ratification.</p><p>The Vienna Convention, despite not mandating parties to take concrete actions on ozone protection laid the foundations for adoption of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#montreal-protocol">The Montreal Protocol</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-parties-env-agreements?country=OWID_WRL-6" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-parties-env-agreements?country=OWID_WRL-6" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/number-of-parties-env-agreements-5f2bee88c0278fb7c4c36fb1c0625fca_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="montreal-protocol"><a class="deep-link" href="#montreal-protocol"></a>Montreal Protocol</h4><p>The <em>Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer</em>&#xA0;is arguably the most successful international treaty to date.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a>&#xA0;The Montreal Protocol is an international protocol to the Vienna Convention, agreed in 1987 before entering into force in 1989.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> Its purpose was to phase-out (reduce and eventually eliminate) the use of man-made ozone-depleting substances for protection of the ozone layer.</p><p>Using the &apos;play&apos; button and timeline in the chart below we can observe how the Montreal Protocol was adopted across the world since 1987.

Using statistics on <strong>reported emissions</strong> of CFC-11 submitted by parties to the Montreal Protocol, it is possible to construct estimates and projections of what change in atmospheric concentration should occur based on such levels of emissions.

As we see, actual and expected concentration changes map closely over the period up to 2011. Since 2012, however, the annual rate of decline in concentrations has fallen (almost halved from -0.8 percent to -0.4 percent per year). This is highly inconsistent with the expected rate of change which would have resulted in the case that reported emissions to the Montreal Protocol were correct.

Overall, ozone depletion increases with latitude with low levels of depletion at the equator and tropics, and highest depletion at the poles. Although depletion has occurred over both the Antarctic and Artic poles, Antarctica has experienced the most severe development of the &apos;ozone hole&apos;. Why is this the case?</p><p>An important condition for ozone depletion is very cold atmospheric temperatures. This factor alone explains the concentration of ozone depletion at the poles rather than at lower latitudes. Ozone depletion has been most severe over Antarctica because it <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/assessments/ozone/2010/twentyquestions/Q10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides the unique temperature and chemical conditions</a> for effective ozone destruction by halogen gases.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>Formation of the &apos;ozone hole&apos; requires &apos;polar stratospheric clouds&apos; (PSCs) to form; this occurs when temperatures fall below their formation temperature of around -78&#xB0;C. This occurs for only 1-2 months in Arctic regions, but across 5 to 6 months in Antarctica through winter and early spring. The liquid and solid particles in PSCs allow highly reactive chlorine gas to be formed when halogen gases and sunlight are present. This highly reactive chlorine gas is then very effective in breaking down stratospheric ozone. It is these unique conditions through the winter and early spring that result in high ozone destruction over Antarctica.</p><h3 id="impacts-on-uv-irradiation"><a class="deep-link" href="#impacts-on-uv-irradiation"></a>Impacts on UV irradiation</h3><p>The primary concern of the &apos;ozone hole&apos; has been its impact on the quantity of UV-B radiation reaching Earth&apos;s surface. As discussed <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#ozone-and-its-impact-through-the-atmosphere">earlier in this entry</a>, stratospheric ozone plays a fundamental role in protecting surface lifeforms from exposure to harmful levels of UV-B radiation. This &apos;good ozone&apos;&#xA0;typically absorbs 97-99 percent of incoming UV-B radiation.</p><p>Depletion of stratospheric ozone has therefore had an impact on the quantity of UV irradiation reaching Earth&apos;s surface. In the figure below we show the average percentage change in UV irradiation reach the surface in 2008 relative to levels in 1979.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> This is shown across latitudes (extending from -60&#xB0; (South) to&#xA0;60&#xB0; (North), with each line representing the change for a given wavelength of UV irradiation. Shown are the changes across wavelengths from 305 to 325 nanometres, which is the region where DNA damage from UV irradiation has its largest health impacts.</p><p>Here we see that the largest increases in UV irradiation have been at high latitudes&#xA0;&#x2014; particularly in the South Hemisphere. At 305 nm, for example, irradiance at high Southern latitudes increased by more than 25 percent over this period. At the Northern poles, this was much less at between 5 to 10 percent.</p><p><a href="/uploads/2018/04/Changes-in-UV-irradiation-reaching-surface-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18751" src="/uploads/2018/04/Changes-in-UV-irradiation-reaching-surface-01.png" alt="" width="10142" height="7424"></a></p><h3 id="impacts-on-skin-cancer-risk"><a class="deep-link" href="#impacts-on-skin-cancer-risk"></a>Impacts on skin cancer risk</h3><p>Ozone layer protection from UV-B irradiation is critical to the health of many lifeforms, including human health.

However, the ambition to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) has also produced co-benefits for <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas</a> reduction.</p><p>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and other halogen gases typically have a high global warming potential (GWP): they are powerful greenhouse gases with a high capacity to trap heat in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. With a GWP <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#ozone-depleting-substances">up to 10,000 times higher</a> than <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</a>, these gases can have a notable impact on total greenhouse gas emissions, even in very small concentrations.</p><p>The reduction in ODS, in particular CFCs has therefore had a significant impact on greenhouse gas reduction in recent years.

This is based on the latest report from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on the <em>Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion</em>.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a> In red/orange we show the actual trends in ozone-depleting substances, with the very obvious impact of the implementation of the Montreal Protocol on the reduction of GHG emissions and plateauing of radiative forcing.

The blue area therefore represents the estimated quantity of GHG or radiative forcing averted as a result of the Montreal Protocol.</p><p>The greenhouse gas emissions averted as a result of the reduction in ODSs is substantial: it&apos;s estimated that without the Montreal Protocol, radiative forcing from ODSs could have reached 0.60 to 0.65 W/m<sup>2</sup>&#xA0;in 2010 which was approximately 35 percent that of CO<sub>2</sub>&#xA0;emissions.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> GHG emissions from ODSs in 2010 could have reached approximately 10 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents (which would have been five times the annual target of the Kyoto Protocol for the 2008-2012 period).<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a> If increasing trends of ODSs had continued through to 2020, the WMO project that total GHG emissions from halogen gases could have approximated 20 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents (relative to 36 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2017)&#xA0;&#x2014; this would have been an increase of more than 50 percent to global GHG emissions.</p><p>Following phaseout of CFCs, HFCs (which do not deplete ozone) have been increasingly substituted for HCFCs (which do deplete ozone) as part of the Montreal Protocol. This means HFC emissions have increased notably in recent years. However, HFCs have a large global-warming potential (as shown in the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#ozone-depleting-substances">table in the Data Definitions</a> section); and could begin to cancel out climate benefits made by the rapid reduction of CFCs and HCFCs in recent decades.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a> If we are to preserve the climate benefits of the Montreal Protocol, further emissions and potential substitutes for CFC products will be important in the coming years.<a href="/uploads/2018/06/Impact-of-ozone-depleting-substances-on-GHG-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19361" src="/uploads/2018/06/Impact-of-ozone-depleting-substances-on-GHG-01.png" alt="" width="595" height="971"></a></p></section>

ODP tonnes attempt to standardise and correct for the differences in the potential ozone destruction across different substances.</p><p>In the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ozone-layer#ozone-depleting-substances">table in the section below</a>, we provide a list of substances and their respective ODP values; ODP values provide a measure of the relative destruction potential of one tonne of that substance relative to chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11). CFC-11 is therefore given a value of 1. For example, HCFCs have an ODP ranging from 0.01 to 0.1, meaning that one tonne of HCFC gas causes 10 to 100 times less ozone destruction than one tonne of CFC-11.</p><p>To calculate ODS tonnes, emissions of a given substance in tonnes is multiplied by its ODP value. For example, ten tonnes of&#xA0;Halon-1301 would result in 152 ODP tonnes (= 10 * 15.2). The sum of all of halogen gases in ODP tonnes provides a total measure of ozone-depleting substance emissions.</p><p>ODP tonnes can also be reported as CFC-11-equivalents, since all values are normalised to the depletion potential of CFC-11 (which is given an ODP value of 1).</p><h3 id="emissions-vs-production-vs-concentration"><a class="deep-link" href="#emissions-vs-production-vs-concentration"></a>Emissions vs. production vs. concentration</h3><p>In the entry above we present data on <strong><em>production/consumption, emissions, and stratospheric concentrations</em></strong> of ozone-depleting substances. It&apos;s important to note the distinction between these measures, and why they are not equivalent.</p><p><strong>Production/consumption&#xA0;</strong>of ozone-depleting substances refers to the primary production of new materials or products containing any of the halogen gases noted as ODS. The important aspect to note here that this relates to the production or release of new/recent substances.</p><p><strong>Emissions</strong> of ozone-depleting substances can be natural or man-made. Small, relatively consistent levels of ozone-depleting substances are emitted through natural processes. Most discussion in relation to ODS emissions therefore focuses on man-made emissions which can be controlled.</p><p>Emissions of ODS result from the production/consumption of new materials or products, but they can also occur in the absence of new production. The use of halogen gases in products such as refrigerants, solvents and foams has been persistent since the early 20th century. These gases still reside in some products which are liable to leakage over time. In the case of chlorofluorocarbons, these are called &apos;CFC banks&apos;.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></p><p>The storage and persistence of &apos;old&apos; reservoirs/sources of ozone-depleting substances means that emissions can continue over time, even in the absence of new production of these substances.</p><p><strong>Concentrations&#xA0;</strong>of ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere are determined by the stock of substances, in addition to the balance of inputs and outputs over time. The lifetime of gases in the atmosphere play an important role in understanding how their concentrations change over time.</p><p>Even once emissions of ODS cease; why does the concentration of these substances not return to zero? In the table in the following section we detail the average atmospheric &apos;lifetime&apos; of specific substances. For many substances, this timeframe is on the scale of decades (up to a century).
