But despite the popularity and familiarity of world maps, they can mislead our understanding of how living conditions around the world are changing. They are made for a different purpose; geographical maps show us where the world&#x2019;s land masses are and where country borders run. They don&#x2019;t show us where the people are.</p><p>If we want to show where the world&#x2019;s people are we need a <em>population cartogram</em>, a geographical presentation of the world where the size of the countries are not drawn according to the distribution of land, but according to the distribution of people.</p><p>So I spent the last few weekends making this cartogram for the world population in 2018.</p><p>The cartogram is made up of squares, each of which represents half a million people of a country&#x2019;s population. The 11.5 million Belgians are represented by 23 squares; the 49.5 million Colombians are represented by 99 squares; the 1.415 billion people in China are represented by 2830 squares; and this year&#x2019;s entire world population of 7.633 billion people is represented by the total sum of 15,266 squares.</p><p>As the size of the population rather than the size of the territory is shown in this map you can see some big differences when you compare it to the standard geographical map we&apos;re most familiar with. Small countries with a high <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/population-density">population density</a> increase in size in this cartogram relative to the world maps we are used to &#x2013; look at Bangladesh, Taiwan, or the Netherlands. Large countries with a small population shrink in size &#x2013; talking about you Canada, Mongolia, Australia, and Russia.</p><h3 id="keep-this-cartogram-in-mind-when-reading-other-charts"><a class="deep-link" href="#keep-this-cartogram-in-mind-when-reading-other-charts"></a>Keep this cartogram in mind when reading other charts</h3><p>We should keep this cartogram in mind when we are looking at charts that show country-by-country data, because we have to remember that the number of people that these charts speak about is very different from one country to the next: An increase of the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy">life expectancy</a> in Denmark means that the average health of 5.8 million people is increasing, while an increase for India means that the health of 1,354 million people is improving. And a line chart that shows improvements in all African countries or across all of the American countries refers to fewer people than a chart with a single line that shows an improvement in China. The two largest countries in Asia &#x2013; China or India &#x2013; are the home of more people than any other entire continent.</p><h6>Cartogram of the World Population in 2018<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></h6><p style="text-align: center;"><small><em>[click on the cartogram to enlarge it.

Here are some that stand out for me:</p><ul>
<li>The area of Russia takes up 11% of the world&#x2019;s land and the gigantic country borders both Norway and North Korea. But Russia is home to only less than 2% of the world population and is therefore shrunken in this cartogram to the size of Bangladesh, a country that is smaller than Florida.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>13 countries in the world are home to more than 100 million people: China (1.415 billion), India (1.354 billion), United States (326.8m), Indonesia (266.8m), Brazil (210.9m), Pakistan (200.8m), Nigeria (195.9m), Bangladesh (166.4m), Russia (144m), Mexico (130.8m), Japan (127.2m), Ethiopia (107.5m), Philippines (106.5m).
<ul>
<li>A 14th country is very close though, Egypt is <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/UN-population-projection-medium-variant?country=EGY">expected to reach 100 million</a> next year.</li>
<li>Together these 13 countries are the home of 4.75 billion people, 62% of the world population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h4 id="asia-and-oceania"><a class="deep-link" href="#asia-and-oceania"></a>Asia and Oceania</h4><p>The cartogram below focusses on Asia and Oceania where 6 out of 10 people in the world live.</p><ul>
<li>Within this world region the population is very unequally distributed. South-East Asia is densely populated while large countries such as Mongolia, Australia, Kazakhstan, and the Asian part of Russia are home to relatively few people. And again within countries we see a very high concentration. The metropolitan area of Beijing has the same population as all of Australia. Tokyo&#x2019;s population almost equals the population of all of Oceania.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>China and India are by far the most populous countries in the world. If you want to follow what is happening to the world you have to keep track of these two countries:
<ul>
<li>More than a third of the world population &#x2013; 36.2% &#x2013; live in India and China.</li>
<li>60% of all Asians live in China or India.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>Today, both India and China have a larger population than the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth#long-run-historical-perspective">entire world population in 1850</a> (when the world population was around 1.26 billion people).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But while China and India dominate, other Asian countries are also very populous: Seven of the world&#x2019;s 13 countries with more than 100 million inhabitants are in Asia.</li>
<li>Population growth in Asia has been rapid in the last decades: The population of Asia has <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth#shares-by-world-regions">tripled</a> in size since 1950.</li>
<li>And while some countries in Asia have already reached the last stage of the demographic transition some others still have rapid population growth ahead. The <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/children-per-woman-UN?tab=chart&amp;country=IND+OWID_WRL">fertility rate in India</a> has fallen from 6 children per woman in the 1960s to 2.35 children today, but population momentum means that population growth will continue for another 4 decades. According to the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/UN-population-projection-medium-variant?country=IND">UN&apos;s population projection</a> the population of India is expected to reach 1.68 billion in 2060 and the country is then expected to be the most populous country in the world.</li>

<li>The USA &#x2013; the third most populous country in the world &#x2013; is by far the most populous country on the American continent. Its population is roughly as large as the population of the two runner-ups &#x2013; Brazil and Mexico &#x2013; combined.</li>
<li>Canada has a population density of just 4 people per km&#xB2; &#x2013; in the cartogram the second largest country in world (by area) is reduced to not much more than a slim line of squares.</li>
<li>The shape of the South American countries stays similar to what we would see on a geographical map. This is because the population density across the different South American countries is relatively similar.</li>
<li>The population of the American continent has increased very rapidly over the course of the last few generations. <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-population-by-world-regions-post-1820">Historical estimates</a> suggest that in 1820 the population was only around 35.5 million. At the time this made up just 3.4% of the world population.</li>
<li>Over the last two centuries the population growth rate in the Americas (28-fold) was much faster than in Europe (3-fold), Africa (14-fold), or Asia (6-fold).<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
<li>And some countries in the Americas had even faster population growth. The size of the US population in the 13 founding states at the time of <em>Declaration of Independence,</em> for example, is estimated to have been only 2.5 million.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>

<li>While the population of Europe is small, the continent is economically very powerful and much richer than most other parts of the world. The <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/economic-growth#gdp-per-capita-in-us-dollar">per capita output and income</a> of the Swedes for example is 30-fold higher than the per capita output and income of the Indians and 8-times higher than the per capita output or income of the Chinese.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
