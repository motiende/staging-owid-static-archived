In the first chart, we have plotted cereal crops (wheat, barley and oats). Overall, we see that improvements in cereal yields from the 19th century into the first half of the 20th century were relatively slow-- by the 1940s, yields were typically in the range of 2-2.5 tonnes per hectare. Productivity gains between the 1950s and 1990s was rapid, growing 2-3 fold over this period. Since the turn of the millennium however, cereal yields in the UK have been relatively stagnant.</p><p>In the second chart below we see UK yields in sugar beet and potatoes--these roots and tuber crops tend to have much higher yields than cereal crops by mass (although they are likely to have a much higher percentage of water weight). Similarly to cereal yields, productivity gains in sugar beet and potatoes have been most impressive over the latter half of the 20th century. Since 1960, yields in sugar beet have more than doubled, rising from 30 tonnes to more than than 80 tonnes per hectare. Potato yields have also almost doubled, increasing from just over 20 tonnes in 1960 to more than 40 tonnes per hectare in 2014.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/long-term-cereal-yields-in-the-united-kingdom" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/long-term-cereal-yields-in-the-united-kingdom" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/long-term-cereal-yields-in-the-united-kingdom_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/long-term-agricultural-yields-in-the-united-kingdom" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/long-term-agricultural-yields-in-the-united-kingdom" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/long-term-agricultural-yields-in-the-united-kingdom_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="wheat-yields-across-europe-from-1850"><a class="deep-link" href="#wheat-yields-across-europe-from-1850"></a>Wheat Yields across Europe from 1850</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/long-term-wheat-yields-in-europe" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/long-term-wheat-yields-in-europe" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/long-term-wheat-yields-in-europe_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="us-average-corn-grain-yields-1866-2014"><a class="deep-link" href="#us-average-corn-grain-yields-1866-2014"></a>US average corn grain yields, 1866-2014</h4><p>In the chart below we have plotted average corn (maize) yields in the United States from 1866-2014, based on data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and UN FAO. As seen below, average corn yields in the United States remained relatively flat throughout the 1800s until the 1930s. In the period since 1940, yields have increased more than five-fold.</p><p>What caused this significant drive in yield improvements? There are a number of factors which are likely to have contributed to sustained yield gains: fertilizer application, irrigation, increased soil tillage, and improved farming practices. However, a key driver in the initial rise in yield is considered to be the adoption of improved corn varieties from <a href="http://passel.unl.edu/pages/informationmodule.php?idinformationmodule=1075412493&amp;topicorder=10&amp;maxto=12&amp;minto=1">plant breeding developments</a>. The initial period of yield gains in the late 1930s-early 1940s coincides with the transition period of farmers from open-pollinated varieties to hybrids. This process of cross-breeding between open-pollinated varieties, combined with improved breed selection practices is thought to define the key turning point in US corn yields.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-corn-yields-in-the-united-states-1866-2014" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-corn-yields-in-the-united-states-1866-2014" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/average-corn-yields-in-the-united-states-1866-2014_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="cereal-yields-in-chile-1929-2014"><a class="deep-link" href="#cereal-yields-in-chile-1929-2014"></a>Cereal yields in Chile, 1929-2014</h4><p>In the chart below we see the average yields in key cereal crops (wheat, barley and oats) in Chile from 1929-2014.

The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) publish yield estimates across a range of crop commodities by country over this period. The FAO report yield values as the national average for any given year; this is calculated by diving total crop output (in kilograms or tonnes) by the area of land used to grow a given crop (in hectares). There are likely to be certain regional and seasonal differences in yield within a given country, however, reported average yields still provide a useful indication of changes in productivity over time and geographical region.</p><p>In the chart below we see the change in average yield for key crop commodities since 1961.

Only 71 percent of Earth&apos;s land surface is defined as habitable; the remaining 29 percent comprises of glaciers and barren land. Here, &apos;barren land&apos; refers to land cover in which less than one-third of the area has vegetation or other cover; barren land typically has thin soil, sand or rocks and includes deserts, dry salt flats, beaches, sand dunes, and exposed rocks.</p><p>Humans use half of global habitable area for agricultural production (of the remainder, 37 percent is forested; 11 percent as shrubbery; and only one-percent is utilised as urban infrastructure).</p><p>More than three-quarters of our agricultural land is used for the rearing of livestock through a combination of grazing land and land used for animal feed production. Despite being dominant in land allocation for agriculture, meat and dairy products supply only 17 percent of global caloric supply and only 33 percent of global protein supply. In other words, the 11 million square kilometres used for crops supply more calories and protein for the global population than the almost 4-times larger area used for livestock.</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/10/Land-use-graphic-01-01-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12927" src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/10/Land-use-graphic-01-01-01.png" alt="" width="6251" height="4377"></a></p><h4 id="how-the-world-s-land-is-used-total-area-sizes-by-type-of-use-cover"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-the-world-s-land-is-used-total-area-sizes-by-type-of-use-cover"></a>How the world&apos;s land is used: total area sizes by type of use &amp; cover</h4><p>Visualising land use areas on a global map is perhaps the most relatable way to understand the scale of different land uses across the world.

Note that these are not used to represent the distribution of each: this figure does not mean the United States is wholly used for livestock, or that Europe comprises only of barren land. It is used to indicate the global areal extent of each land use only.</p><p>We see that:</p><ul>
<li>global land allocated to livestock - either in the form of grazing land or cropland used for animal feed is equivalent to the area of the Americas (North, Central and South America combined);</li>
<li>cropland (minus land used for the production of animal feed) is equivalent to the area of East Asia-Pacific, extending as far south as Thailand;</li>
<li>forested area is equal to Africa (minus Libya), the Middle East and South Asia;</li>
<li>global freshwater (inland water bodies) approximates to the area of Mongolia</li>
<li>total build-up land (villages, towns, cities &amp; infrastructure) would fit into an area the size of Libya;</li>
<li>shrub land is equivalent to an area the size of East Asia-Pacific, from Malaysia southwards;</li>

But how much of total land area is utilised for agriculture across the world? In the map below we see the share of total (both habitable and non-habitable) land area used for agriculture from 1961-2014.</p><p>There is large variability in the share of land a given country uses for agriculture. Allocation ranges from less than ten percent, particularly across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Scandinavian region to close to 80 percent across most regions (including the UK, Uruguay, South Africa, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia). It&apos;s important to note that this metric includes both land used for arable (cropland) production and pasture land for livestock grazing; this means that agriculture can consume a large share of land area, even in arid and semi-arid regions where extensive arable farming is not possible. We will explore this difference in cropland and pastureland in the following section.</p><p>If we view the map below in &quot;chart&quot; mode, we see how the allocation of land to agriculture has changed over time across the global regions. The share of land used for agriculture has been slowly increasing across most of the world&apos;s regions over the past few decades.

However, most projections suggest a peaking of land expansion in the timespan between 2020 and 2040. Our measured agricultural area appears to be most closely aligned to the FAO/IMAGE projection, which is characterised by a very slow increase in areal extent over the coming decades before peaking around 2040.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/projections-for-global-peak-agricultural-land" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/projections-for-global-peak-agricultural-land" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/projections-for-global-peak-agricultural-land_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="land-use-by-crop-type"><a class="deep-link" href="#land-use-by-crop-type"></a>Land use by crop type</h3><p>In the chart below we see the global area of land use in agriculture by major crop types, from 1961 to 2014.

The total land area used for coarse grains has remained approximately constant over this 50 year period, and is the 2nd largest user of arable land.</p><p>The most dramatic increase in land allocation is in the production of oilcrops.

At the upper end of the spectrum we find meat products, with the land required for beef or mutton up to 100 times larger than cereals. However, it&apos;s important to note the differences in land required across the meat products: poultry and pork have a land footprint 8-10 times lower than that of beef. This means individuals can make notable reductions in the environmental impact of their diets simply by substituting lower-impact meat products for beef or mutton. &#xA0;</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-gram-of-protein-by-food-type" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/land-use-per-gram-of-protein-by-food-type" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/land-use-per-gram-of-protein-by-food-type_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>

As we discussed <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture/#land-projections-to-2050-60-have-we-reached-peak-farmland">earlier in the entry</a>, Ausubel, Wernick &amp; Waggoner (2013) applied a simplified model of these variables to predict when the world would reach &apos;peak farmland&apos;.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Ausubel defines it as the IMPACT model, where land use is determined by five key variables:</p><ol>
<li><strong>P</strong> = Population (number of people to feed)</li>
<li><strong>A</strong> = Affluence (in GDP per capita)</li>
<li><strong>C1</strong> = Consumption 1 (in kcal/GDP), where kcal refers to the annual national or global food supply in kilocalories from both vegetal and animal sources. C1 provides a measure of how much our kilocalorie (i.e. food) intake increases (or decreases) as we get richer or poorer.</li>
<li><strong>C2</strong> = Consumption 2 (in Crop Production Index [PIN]/kcal) using the FAO Crop Production Index, which measures the relative level of aggregate volume of agricultural crop production indexed to a base year. C2 tracks the ratio of crop production for food, feed, fuel, fiber, and tobacco to the supply of food calories. This means it provides a measure of how much food is produced relative to how much food is eaten (i.e. the efficiency of the system in delivering food from the field to peoples&apos; plates). If we reallocate more food towards feed and fuel, for example, we would have to continue increasing agricultural output to ensure food supplies remain adequate.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>T</strong> = Technology (in hectares/Crop PIN) tracks how much land farmers use relative to total crop value. This is a measure of agricultural yield/productivity.</li>
</ol><p>We are therefore left with the equation, where:</p><p><strong>Im (arable land in hectares) = P * A * C<sub>1</sub> * C<sub>2&#xA0;</sub>* T</strong></p><p>Or the rate of change in arable land is equal to the sum of the rates of change in these variables (in percent per year):</p><p><strong>im = p + a + c<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub> + t</strong></p><h4 id="how-did-ausubel-s-predictions-differ-from-reality"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-did-ausubel-s-predictions-differ-from-reality"></a>How did Ausubel&apos;s predictions differ from reality?</h4><p>In order to assess why Ausubel et al. (2013) predicted we would reach &apos;peak farmland&apos; prematurely, we assessed how their predicted values for each of the variables differed from actual values over the period 2009-2014. It should be noted that the authors derived their rate of decline (at 0.2 percent per year) based on an average prediction over the period 2010-2060; therefore a divergence from this value over the first 5-year period does not necessarily confirm these averaged predictions to be false.</p><p>In the table below, we provide a comparison of the values used in Ausubel&apos;s projection, and our own analysis of changes in these variables from 2009-2014 (measured in percent change per year). Whilst Ausubel predicted a 0.2 percent decline in arable land area per year, our analysis suggests a 0.37 percent increase per year over this 5-year period. This correlates very closely to the actual land in land use; FAO figures suggest this also grew at 0.37 percent per year.</p><div class="tableContainer"><table style="height: 343px; width: 797px;">

The noticeable shrinkage in the extent of cropland as a function of the Crop Production index since 1990 (Figure below) provides encouragement that farmers will continue sparing land.&apos;</em></p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/08/ourworldindata_land-per-crop-pin-750x525.png" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-12884 aligncenter" src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2017/08/ourworldindata_land-per-crop-pin-750x525.png" alt="" width="780" height="546"></a></p><h4 id="production-yield-and-land-use-changes-over-time"><a class="deep-link" href="#production-yield-and-land-use-changes-over-time"></a>Production, yield and land use changes over time</h4><p>In the chart below we see index trends in cereal production, yield, land use and population measured from 1961 (i.e. 1961 = 100). From 1961 to 2014, global cereal production has increased by 280 percent. If we compare this increase to that of total population (which increased only 136 percent over the same period), we see that global cereal production has increased at a much faster rate than that of population. If distributed equally, cereal production per person has increased despite a growing population.</p><p>Have we achieved this through land expansion or improved yields? A bit of both. In 2014, we used 16% more land for cereal production than we did in 1961 (approximately equivalent to double the area of Germany). Overall, this means we use less land per person than we did fifty years ago. Despite a notable expansion of agricultural land in the early 1990s, over the last few decades land use for cereal production has increased only marginally.</p><p>Most of our improvements in cereal production have arisen from improvements in yield. The average cereal yield has increased by 175 percent since 1961. Today, the world can produce almost three-times as much cereal from a given area of land as it did in 1961.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/index-of-cereal-production-yield-and-land-use-1961-2014" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/index-of-cereal-production-yield-and-land-use-1961-2014" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/index-of-cereal-production-yield-and-land-use-1961-2014_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="yields-vs-land-use"><a class="deep-link" href="#yields-vs-land-use"></a>Yields vs. Land Use</h4><p>There is therefore an important relationship between yields improvements and land use. In order to grow more food, we can increase the output from a given area of land (called &apos;intensification&apos;), or expand the area over which we grow our food (called &apos;extensification&apos;). Increasing yields reduces the pressure of expanding agricultural land.</p><p>In the chart below, we see the indexed change in land area used for cereal production from 1961-2014 (on the y-axis), measured against the indexed change in cereal yield over the same period (on the x-axis). In these trends we see large regional differences in this yield-land use trade-off.</p><p>Most European, American (both North and Latin American), Asian and Pacific countries have seen a much larger increase in cereal yields relative to area used for production. For many, changes in the arable land have been minimal (or have declined). This is an important contrast to Africa where results are more mixed. Some countries, including Ethiopia, Nigeria and Algeria have followed the rest of the world in yield increases. However, a failure to increase agricultural productivity in many Sub-Saharan countries has led to large increases in land used for cereal production.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yields-change-vs-land-use-change" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yields-change-vs-land-use-change" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/yields-change-vs-land-use-change_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="different-approaches-to-growing-food-south-asia-vs-sub-saharan-africa"><a class="deep-link" href="#different-approaches-to-growing-food-south-asia-vs-sub-saharan-africa"></a>Different approaches to growing food: South Asia vs. Sub-Saharan Africa</h4><p>This trade-off between land use for agriculture and yields is very clearly exemplified in a comparison between cereal production in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Expansion of cereal production has followed very different paths in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.</p><p>Land use for cereal production in South Asia has increased by less than 20 percent since 1961, meanwhile cereal yields have more than tripled &#x2013; which meant that much more food could be produced in South Asia without an equivalent extension of the agricultural land. This is in strong contrast to Sub-Saharan Africa where the area of land used for cereal production has more than doubled since 1961 and yields have only increased by 80 percent.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-change-of-cereal-yield-vs-the-change-of-land-used-for-cereal-production-1961-2014" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-change-of-cereal-yield-vs-the-change-of-land-used-for-cereal-production-1961-2014" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/the-change-of-cereal-yield-vs-the-change-of-land-used-for-cereal-production-1961-2014_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="land-sparing-from-improvements-in-cereal-yields"><a class="deep-link" href="#land-sparing-from-improvements-in-cereal-yields"></a>Land sparing from improvements in cereal yields</h4><p>Although there are a few exceptions--notably across Sub-Saharan Africa, the continued increase in cereal yields across the world has been the major driver of total cereal production. This has inevitably allowed us to &apos;spare&apos; land we would have otherwise had to convert for cereal production.</p><p>In the chart below we see that the global area under cereal production (in blue) has increased from 625 to 721 million hectares from 1961-2014. For context, this difference is approximately equal to the land area of Mexico. However, if global average cereal yields were to have remained at their 1961 levels, we see the amount of additional land (in red, below) which we would have had to convert to arable land if we were to achieve the same levels of cereal production. This &apos;spared&apos; land amounts to 1.26 billion hectares in 2014-- roughly equal to the area of Mexico and Europe combined.</p><p>We currently use <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-in-agriculture/#the-breakdown-of-global-land-use-today">approximately 50 percent</a> of global habitable land for agriculture; without cereal yield increases, this may have risen to 62 percent. This agricultural expansion would likely have been into fertile forested land, resulting in a loss of up to one-third of the world&apos;s forests.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-land-spared-as-a-result-of-cereal-yield-improvements" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-land-spared-as-a-result-of-cereal-yield-improvements" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/global-land-spared-as-a-result-of-cereal-yield-improvements_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>










































<section><h2 id="data-quality-definition"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definition"></a>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2><h3 id="yields"><a class="deep-link" href="#yields"></a>Yields</h3><p>The definition for &apos;crop yield&apos; given by the FAO is &apos;Harvested production per unit of harvested area for crop products. In most of the cases yield data are not recorded but obtained by dividing the production data by the data on area harvested. Data on yields of permanent crops are not as reliable as those for temporary crops either because most of the area information may correspond to planted area, as for grapes, or because of the scarcity and unreliability of the area figures reported by the countries, as for example for cocoa and coffee.&apos;<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><h3 id="agricultural-land-use"><a class="deep-link" href="#agricultural-land-use"></a>Agricultural Land Use</h3><p>The Land Area of the World is 13,003 million ha. 4,889 million ha are classified as &apos;agricultural area&apos; by the FAO (this is 37.6% of the Land Area).</p><p>The agricultural area use is divided into 3 categories: arable land (28% of the global agricultural area), permanent crops (3%) and permanent meadows and pastures (69%) which account for the largest share of the world&apos;s agricultural area.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>What do these words mean?</p><p>The <strong>agricultural area</strong> is the sum of arable land, permanent crops, permanent meadows and pastures.</p><p>The FAO definition for <strong>arable land</strong> is land under temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years). The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included in this category. Data for &#x201C;Arable land&#x201D; are not meant to indicate the amount of land that is potentially cultivable.&apos;<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>The same source defines <strong>permanent crops </strong>as follows: &apos;Permanent crops are divided into temporary and permanent crops. Permanent crops are sown or planted once, and then occupy the land for some years and need not be replanted after each annual harvest, such as cocoa, coffee and rubber. This category includes flowering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees and vines, but excludes trees grown for wood or timber. And again from the same source the definition for <em>permanent meadows and pastures </em>is &apos;land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops, either cultivated or growing wild (wild prairie or grazing land).&apos;</p><p>The FAO definition for <strong>f</strong><strong>allow land</strong> is &apos;the cultivated land that is not seeded for one or more growing seasons. The maximum idle period is usually less than five years.&apos;</p></section>
