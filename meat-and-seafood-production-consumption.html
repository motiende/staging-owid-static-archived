The chart below shows global meat production by region, measured in tonnes.</p><p>Regionally, Asia is the largest meat producer, accounting for around 40-45 percent of total meat production. This regional distribution has changed significantly in recent decades. In 1961, Europe and North America were the dominant meat producers, accounting for 42 and 25 percent, respectively. In 1961, Asia produced only 12 percent. By 2013, Europe and North America&apos;s share had fallen to 19 and 15 percent, respectively.</p><p>This reduction in production share was <em>despite</em> a large increase in production in absolute terms: Europe&apos;s meat output has approximately doubled over this period, whilst North American output has increase 2.5-fold. Production increases in Asia, however, have been staggering: meat production has increased 15-fold since 1961.</p><p>Absolute increases in production in other regions have also been substantial, with output in all regions (with exception to the Caribbean which approximately tripled) growing more than 5-fold over this period.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/meat-production-tonnes?tab=chart" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/meat-production-tonnes?tab=chart" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/meat-production-tonnes-a847e6c96bb2640c05a8cd075949d1bb_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="total-meat-production-by-type"><a class="deep-link" href="#total-meat-production-by-type"></a>Total meat production by type</h4><p>In the chart below we see how meat production has changed by livestock type over this period.</p><p>At a global level we see that the dominant livestock types are poultry, cattle (which includes beef and buffalo meat), pig, and sheep &amp; goat to a lesser extent. However, the distribution of meat types varies significantly across the world; in some countries, other meat types such as wild game, horse, and duck can account for a significant share of total production.</p><p>Although production of all major meat types have been increasing in absolute terms, in relative terms the share of global meat types have changed significantly over the last 50 years. In 1961, poultry meat accounted for only 12 percent of global meat production; by 2013 its share has approximately tripled to around 35 percent. In comparison, beef and buffalo meat as a share of total meat production has nearly halved, now accounting for around 22 percent. Pigmeat&apos;s share has remained more constant at approximately 35-40 percent.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-meat-production-by-livestock-type" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-meat-production-by-livestock-type" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/global-meat-production-by-livestock-type_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="beef-and-buffalo-cattle-meat-production"><a class="deep-link" href="#beef-and-buffalo-cattle-meat-production"></a>Beef and buffalo (cattle) meat production</h4><p>In the chart below we see the global production of cattle (beef and buffalo) meat.

But how has meat consumption changed on a per capita basis?</p><p>In the chart below we see a global map of per capita meat (excluding seafood and fish) consumption, measured in kilograms per person per year. These trends can also be viewed as a time-series in the &quot;chart&quot; tab. As a global average, per capita meat consumption has increased approximately 20 kilograms since 1961; the average person consumed around 43 kilograms of meat in 2014. This increase in per capita meat trends means total meat production has been growing at a much faster than the rate of population growth.</p><p>The direction and rate of change across countries has highly variable. Growth in per capita meat consumption has been most marked in countries who have underwent a strong economic transition - per capita consumption in China has grown approximately 15-fold since 1961; rates in Brazil have nearly quadrupled. The major exception to this pattern has been India: dominant lactovegetarian preferences mean per capita meat consumption in 2013 was almost exactly the same as in 1961 at less than 4 kilograms per person.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Meat consumption is highest across high-income countries (with the largest meat-eaters in Australia, consuming around 116 kilograms per person in 2013). The average European and North American consumes nearly 80 kilograms &#xA0;and more than 110 kilograms, respectively. However, changes in consumption in high-income countries have been much slower - with most stagnating or even decreasing over the last 50 years.</p><p>Consumption trends across Africa are varied; some countries consume as low as 10 kilograms per person, around half of the continental average. Higher-income nations such as South Africa consume between 60-70 kilograms per person.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-meat-consumption-per-person?tab=map" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/annual-meat-consumption-per-person?tab=map" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/annual-meat-consumption-per-person-a42c8357c168ebd03c90930b9d3c439b_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="per-capita-meat-consumption-by-type"><a class="deep-link" href="#per-capita-meat-consumption-by-type"></a>Per capita meat consumption by type</h4><p>What preferences do we have in terms of the types of meat we eat? As a global average, per capita consumption of pigmeat is the highest of meat commodities; in 2013 the average person consumed around 16 kilograms of pigmeat; followed by 15 kilograms of poultry; 9 kilograms of beef/buffalo meat; 2 kilograms of mutton &amp; goat; and only a fraction of other meat types.</p><p>Consumption trends vary significantly across the world. In China, pigmeat accounts for around two-thirds of per capita meat consumption. In Argentina, beef and buffalo meat dominates, accounting for more than half of consumption. New Zealanders have a much stronger preference for mutton &amp; goat meat relative to the global average, consuming nearly 20 kilograms per person in 2013. Whilst other meat types (such as wild game, horse, and rabbit meat) account for a very small fraction of meat consumption at the global level, around one-quarter of meat in Gabon comes from such sources (this has declined from around 70 percent in 1961).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/per-capita-meat-consumption-by-type-kilograms-per-year"

href="#wild-fishery-and-aquaculture-production"></a>Wild fishery and aquaculture production</h3><p>The chart below shows total production from wild fisheries, and aquaculture (fish farming) across all seafood types (including fish, crustaceans and sea plants). As we see, globally catch from wild fisheries has plateaued - and in some cases declined - in recent decades. Aquaculture has, in contrast, grown rapidly particularly over the last 20 years. Global aquaculture production now exceeds that of wild fishery catch.</p><p>The figures below are those reported by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). There have been some suggestions that these figures under-report wild fishery catch, particularly from small-scale fisheries. Below <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/meat-and-seafood-production-consumption#capture-wild-fishery-catch">we present</a> these revised trends, although the pattern of global peaking and reduction in wild fishery catch is maintained.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/capture-fisheries-vs-aquaculture-farmed-fish-production" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/capture-fisheries-vs-aquaculture-farmed-fish-production" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/capture-fisheries-vs-aquaculture-farmed-fish-production_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="capture-wild-fishery-catch"><a class="deep-link" href="#capture-wild-fishery-catch"></a>Capture (wild) fishery catch</h4><p>The first chart below presents FAO wild fishery catch data, broken down by region. Here we see a steady increase in fishery catch until the mid-1990s, when this trend typically levels out in the range of 90-95 million tonnes per year.</p><p>In the following two charts we present revised data published in&#xA0;<em>Nature</em> by Pauly and Zeller (2016).<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> Here, the authors argue that catch from small-scale fisheries is typically under-reported to, and published by the FAO. The authors write:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This data set, however, may not only underestimate artisanal (that is, small scale, commercial) and subsistence fisheries, but also generally omit the catch of recreational fisheries, discarded bycatch&#xA0;and illegal and otherwise unreported catch, even when some estimates are available. Thus, except for a few obvious cases of over-reporting, the landings data updated and disseminated annually by the FAO on behalf of member countries may considerably underestimate actual fisheries catch.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The authors&apos; revised figures therefore show significantly higher fishery catch which peaks around 1996 at 130 million tonnes, before declining to 109 million tonnes in 2010. Although different in magnitude to that of FAO figures, these revised trends support the trend of a global maximum in wild fishery catch (but now with a significant decline). As shown in the charts below, the majority of this decline has resulted from falling industrial catch; small-scale artisanal catch actually increased over this period.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/capture-fishery-production" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/capture-fishery-production" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/capture-fishery-production_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-fishery-catch-by-sector" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-fishery-catch-by-sector" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/global-fishery-catch-by-sector_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-wild-fishery-catch-by-sector" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-wild-fishery-catch-by-sector" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/global-wild-fishery-catch-by-sector_v3_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="aquaculture-production"><a class="deep-link" href="#aquaculture-production"></a>Aquaculture production</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/aquaculture-farmed-fish-production?tab=chart" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/aquaculture-farmed-fish-production?tab=chart" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/aquaculture-farmed-fish-production-a847e6c96bb2640c05a8cd075949d1bb_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="per-capita-trends-in-seafood-consumption"><a class="deep-link" href="#per-capita-trends-in-seafood-consumption"></a>Per capita trends in seafood consumption</h3><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fish-and-seafood-consumption-per-capita" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fish-and-seafood-consumption-per-capita" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/fish-and-seafood-consumption-per-capita_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>

Food Balance Sheets map the quantity of food commodities (measured as their primary equivalents, for example, &quot;wheat and products&quot; represents the sum of all products derived from wheat) from the production level through to the remaining quantity left for human food. This is measured in mass quantities - such as tonnes or kilograms.</p><p>These sheets account for losses and allocations in the food system, including imports, exports, stock variations, seed, animal feed, other (industrial uses), and food losses. The remaining commodities after correction for these diversions is defined as &apos;food supply&apos;. To derive the average per capita food supply, this total figure is divided by the population size. This figure can be considered to be the average level of food intake however it does not account for food wastage at the consumer level (i.e. in households or restaurants).</p><h3 id="what-are-feed-protein-and-energy-conversion-ratios"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-are-feed-protein-and-energy-conversion-ratios"></a>What are feed, protein and energy conversion ratios?</h3><p>Conversion ratios or conversion efficiency are used to measure the ratio of feed inputs (either in the form of food crops, or pasture/grazing land) to output in the form of food product.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a>&#xA0;<strong>Feed conversion ratio (FCR)</strong> is used to measure the mass quantity of feed required to produce one kilogram of animal product (e.g. meat). For example, on average, we have to feed cattle 25 kilograms of feed to produce one kilogram of beef or buffalo meat - this would give us an FCR value of 0.04 (calculated as output (1 kilogram) / input (25 kilograms).</p><p><strong>Protein and energy efficiency</strong> are calculated as the quantity of protein/energy in animal feed which are effectively converted into protein/energy in the resultant animal products. For example, if we feed a chicken 500 grams of protein and only get 100 grams out in chicken meat, we define this protein conversion efficiency as 20 percent (calculated as output (100 grams) / input (500 grams)). The same calculation process applies for energy conversion efficiency using caloric inputs and outputs.</p><h3 id="how-are-land-use-requirements-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-calculated-for-food-products"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-are-land-use-requirements-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-calculated-for-food-products"></a>How are land use requirements and greenhouse gas emissions calculated for food products?</h3><p>Environmental footprints, such as those defined as land use requirements or greenhouse gas emissions per unit mass, protein or calorie of food products are calculated using a process called <strong>life-cycle analysis (LCA)</strong>. LCA methods are used to try to fully capture all environmental impacts across the value chain, and can include those up and downstream of production.</p><p>Standard food footprints - and those referenced in this entry - often set boundary conditions called &apos;cradle-to-farmgate&apos; which means that all impacts in terms of pre-farm and on-farm activities are included.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> This includes food chain inputs such as fertilizer production and application, seed production, energy use on-farm, feed production, manure production (if used as fertilizer), manure management, farm infrastructure construction.</p><p>Life-cycle analyses (LCAs) attempt to fully quantity all such inputs necessary for the production of a food production. For example, a greenhouse gas emissions LCA for beef can include: emissions from fertilizer production, and application used for the production of animal feed; on-farm energy use associated with tilling, irrigation (if needed), transport of feed from field to livestock area, and enteric fermentation emissions produced from cattle, and barn/housing energy requirements. By deriving then summing the emissions associated with each stage and dividing by the total output (in kilograms of meat, units of protein or kilocalories), we can calculate the total emissions per unit mass/protein/kilocalorie.</p></section>
