However, large-scale combustion of coal is typically correlated with the period around the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>The visualisation shows the global consumption of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - from 1800 onwards. Overall, we see that global consumption of fossil energy has increased more than 1300-fold. As shown, coal was the first and only fossil source until the 1860s when crude oil consumption began. Natural gas production began a couple of decades later, in the 1880-90s.</p><p>The 20th century saw a large diversification of fossil energy consumption, with coal declining from 96 percent of total production in 1900 to less than 30 percent in 2000. Today, crude oil is the largest energy source, accounting for around 39 percent of fossil energy, followed by coal and natural gas at 33 and 28 percent, respectively.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-fossil-fuel-consumption" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-fossil-fuel-consumption" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/global-fossil-fuel-consumption_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="fossil-fuel-production-by-country-or-region"><a class="deep-link" href="#fossil-fuel-production-by-country-or-region"></a>Fossil fuel production by country or region</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fossil-fuel-production-over-the-long-term" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fossil-fuel-production-over-the-long-term" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/fossil-fuel-production-over-the-long-term_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="per-capita-fossil-fuel-production-by-country-or-region"><a class="deep-link" href="#per-capita-fossil-fuel-production-by-country-or-region"></a>Per capita fossil fuel production by country or region</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fossil-fuel-production-per-capita" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fossil-fuel-production-per-capita" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/fossil-fuel-production-per-capita_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="fossil-fuel-consumption-by-country-or-region"><a class="deep-link" href="#fossil-fuel-consumption-by-country-or-region"></a>Fossil fuel consumption by country or region</h4><p>The visualisation below presents the fossil fuel consumption mix across individual countries and regions over the last 50 years. Data for different countries and regions can be viewed using the &quot;change country&quot; function of the chart.</p><p>Overall, we see large differences across the world, both in terms of the magnitude of fossil energy consumption and their relative mix. Total consumption levels of fossil fuels in higher-income countries have typically peaked, and are now declining as they transition towards lower-carbon energy sources. For example, the United Kingdom&apos;s total fossil fuel consumption is at its lowest level in the last 50 years. In many lower-income countries, total consumption of fossil fuels continues to increase as a result of both <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth/">population growth</a> and rising incomes (resulting in higher <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/energy-use-per-capita-vs-gdp-per-capita">per capita energy</a> demands).</p><p>The relative mix of coal, oil and gas in total consumption also varies by country. China, for example, sources more than 70 percent of fossil fuel consumption from coal. In contrast, Argentina sources less than two percent from coal, with gas accounting for nearly 60 percent.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fossil-fuel-consumption-by-fuel-type" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fossil-fuel-consumption-by-fuel-type" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/fossil-fuel-consumption-by-fuel-type_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="fossil-fuel-consumption-per-capita"><a class="deep-link" href="#fossil-fuel-consumption-per-capita"></a>Fossil fuel consumption per capita</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fossil-fuel-consumption-per-capita" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/fossil-fuel-consumption-per-capita" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/fossil-fuel-consumption-per-capita_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="coal"><a class="deep-link" href="#coal"></a>Coal</h3><p>The series of charts below present levels of coal production and consumption (which do not necessarily correlate) across the world, by region and country.</p><h4 id="coal-production-by-region"><a class="deep-link" href="#coal-production-by-region"></a>Coal production by region</h4><p>The visualisation below shows recent trends in coal production by region, since 1981. Overall, we see that global coal production more than doubled over this period. Although too early to confirm, global coal production appears to have peaked over the years 2013-14, with several years of declining production since. This would represent a significant peak in global energy, with coal being the first fossil fuel energy source.</p><p>The majority of growth in global coal production has been sourced from the Asia Pacific region, with 5 to 6-fold growth over the last 30 years. Total output from Europe, Eurasia and North America has declined during this period. Asia Pacific now produces more than 70 percent of coal, up from around one-quarter in 1981.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/coal-production-by-region" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/coal-production-by-region" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/coal-production-by-region_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="coal-production-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#coal-production-by-country"></a>Coal production by country</h4><p>The chart and map [which can viewed by switching between tabs below] shows the change in coal production at the country level over the longer-term. Most countries have series data back to the year 1900, with some such as the United Kingdom dating back to 1700.</p><p>The United Kingdom was the first large-scale coal producer - we see its long-run trend growing, peaking just prior to the First World War, and its gradual decline throughout the 20th century. Its production levels are now comparable to those at the beginning of the 1700s.</p><p>Today, China dominates global coal production, accounting for nearly half of total output. This growth has been rapid since the 1960-70s. However, Chinese coal production appears to have peaked, with continued decline in the years since. This decline is likely to have been a key contributor to the apparent global peak in 2013.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/coal-production-by-country" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/coal-production-by-country" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/coal-production-by-country_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="per-capita-coal-production"><a class="deep-link" href="#per-capita-coal-production"></a>Per capita coal production</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/coal-production-per-capita-over-the-long-term" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/coal-production-per-capita-over-the-long-term" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/coal-production-per-capita-over-the-long-term_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="coal-consumption-by-region"><a class="deep-link" href="#coal-consumption-by-region"></a>Coal consumption by region</h4><p>The chart below shows the regional trends in coal <em>consumption</em> over the last fifty years. The relative regional distribution follows a very similar pattern to that of coal production. Asia Pacific is the dominant coal consumer, accounting for nearly three-quarters of global consumption. This share is slightly larger than its share of coal production, suggesting it is a net importer. In contrast, Africa accounts for only 2.5 percent of consumption; less than its 4 percent of production, suggesting it is a net exporter. Collectively, Europe, Eurasia &amp; North America account for less than one-quarter of coal consumption.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/coal-consumption-by-region" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/coal-consumption-by-region" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/coal-consumption-by-region_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="coal-consumption-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#coal-consumption-by-country"></a>Coal consumption by country</h4><p>Below we see these trends in coal consumption at the national level over the last 50 years. Again, China is the world&apos;s dominant coal consumer, accounting for nearly half of global consumption. Like its production trends, China&apos;s coal consumption appears to have peaked in 2013 with several years of sustained decline.</p><p>Other industrialising nations shown strong growth in coal consumption. Driven by continued <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/population-by-country?country=IND">population growth</a> and <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/maddison-data-gdp-per-capita-in-2011us?tab=chart&amp;country=IND">economic development</a>, India&apos;s coal consumption grew more than four-fold from 1960 to 1990, and has more than doubled from 1990 to today.

Unlike coal production (for which it produces a negligible amount), the Middle East is the world&apos;s largest oil producer, accounting for nearly 35 percent. The relative contribution of region&apos;s to the global total has remained generally consistent over the last 50 years, with Europe &amp; Eurasia and North America both accounting for around 20 percent of total production, and Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America &amp; the Caribbean all producing between 8-9 percent.</p><p>Global oil production has increased more than 2.5-fold over the last 50 years, despite more volatile growth relative to coal. The 1970s &apos;oil crisis&apos; resulted in a sudden drop in consumption between 1973-74 following an <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/oil-embargo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oil embargo</a> of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1973. This was followed by another oil shock in 1979 (following the Iranian Revolution) and an &apos;oil glut&apos; in the early 1980s where there was a surplus of crude oil (as a result of reduced consumer demand following the energy crisis of the 1970s).<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> </p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-production-by-region" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-production-by-region" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/oil-production-by-region_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="oil-production-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#oil-production-by-country"></a>Oil production by country</h4><p>The visualisation below shows the change in oil production at the country-level from 1900 onwards, where data is available. This can be explored as a time-series or in map form. In 2014, the United States is the world&apos;s largest country producer of oil, accounting for just under one-fifth of global production. Saudi Arabia is the world&apos;s second largest producer, followed by Russia.</p><p>Types of oil production have influenced the shapes of these trends over time. As explored later in this entry, oil production in the United States looked likely to peak and decline in the 1980s before rising again with the extraction of increasing numbers of shale oil resources.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-production-by-country" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-production-by-country" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/oil-production-by-country_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="oil-consumption-by-region"><a class="deep-link" href="#oil-consumption-by-region"></a>Oil consumption by region</h4><p>The chart below shows oil consumption by region over the last 50 years. Over this period, on relative terms we see a decreasing share of global consumption from Europe, Eurasia &amp; North America in contrast to a rising share in all other regions - most notably Asia Pacific (which has more than tripled in its share of global oil consumption, from around 10 percent in 1965 to 32 percent in 2016).</p><p>In comparison to oil <em>production</em> by region, we see that the Middle East is a much smaller consumer than producer of oil (it produces more than 30 percent, and consumes around 10 percent), meaning it is a large net exporter. In contrast, the Asia Pacific region consumes significantly more oil than it produces (only 8-9 percent production versus 32 percent consumption), meaning it is a net importer.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-consumption-by-region-terawatt-hours-twh" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-consumption-by-region-terawatt-hours-twh" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/oil-consumption-by-region-terawatt-hours-twh_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="oil-consumption-by-country"><a class="deep-link" href="#oil-consumption-by-country"></a>Oil consumption by country</h4><p>Oil consumption broken down by country is shown in the chart below - in chart, and map form.

Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia are also large oil consumers.</p><p>Data availability for consumption levels across Sub-Saharan Africa is low. However, given total regional consumption levels are relatively low, we would also expect consumption levels in most countries to be low relative to other regions.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-consumption-by-country" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-consumption-by-country" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/oil-consumption-by-country_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="oil-consumption-per-capita"><a class="deep-link" href="#oil-consumption-per-capita"></a>Oil consumption per capita</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-consumption-per-capita" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/oil-consumption-per-capita" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/oil-consumption-per-capita_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="natural-gas"><a class="deep-link" href="#natural-gas"></a>Natural gas</h3><p>The series of charts below present levels of natural gas production and consumption (which do not necessarily correlate) across the world, by region and country.</p><h4 id="gas-production-by-region"><a class="deep-link" href="#gas-production-by-region"></a>Gas production by region</h4><p>The regional distribution of natural gas production has changed significantly in recent decades.

Coal sources are typically differentiated based on carbon content; coal richer in carbon tends to produce more energy per unit mass (i.e. it has a higher energy yield). The quality of coal also has implications for air pollution. Fuels richer in carbon tend to have lower concentrations of impurities such as sulphur, meaning they produce lower levels of local air pollutants such as <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/air-pollution/#how-have-global-emissions-of-so2-evolved">sulphur dioxide</a> (SO<sub>2</sub>). nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).</p><p>&apos;Anthracite&apos; coal is typically regarded as the highest quality, followed by bituminous, sub-bituminous and then lignite in decreasing order of quality. In the chart below we see coal reserves categorised based on type and quality. Globally we see that approximately 70 percent of coal reserves are of higher quality (anthracite &amp; bituminous coal), with the remaining 30 percent of sub-bituminous or lignite grade.</p><p>The relative share of coal quality grades vary across the world - national and regional ratios can be explored using the &quot;change country&quot; option.

Fossil fuels - being the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-primary-energy-consumption">dominant source</a> of global energy production - are a key source of <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>However, fossil fuels can vary significantly in their relative emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> per unit energy. To compare these differences, we use a metric called a &apos;carbon dioxide emissions factor&apos; - which is shown for various fossil fuel sources in the chart below. This is measured as the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted (in kilograms) per unit of energy produced (in megawatt-hours). These factors are defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and are applied across global and national accounts of greenhouse gas emissions.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Although there can be notable differences in emissions factors between different types of a given fuel (for example, differences in coal types), there are some more general trends in the relative emissions between coal, oil and gas.

This chart is also available to view in interactive form, <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-crude-oil-price-vs-oil-consumption">here</a>.</p><p>Overall, we see that the sharp changes in oil price coincide with large sociopolitical events - for example, the OPEC oil embargo of 1973 led to a sharp rise in prices; the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the 2008 financial crisis to a sharp decline; and a continued fall in prices since 2011, when US output of shale oil has been consistently growing.</p><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption.png" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-14277 aligncenter" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-750x529.png" alt="Oil prices vs. consumption" width="848" height="598" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-150x106.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-400x282.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-750x529.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption-768x542.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Oil-prices-vs.-consumption.png 6330w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p></section>

However, there is an important distinction between the two. The chart below explains this distinction visually.</p><p>It is true that every reserve is a resource, but not every resource is a reserve. There are two requirements which determine whether a mineral resource becomes a reserve. The first is the degree of certainty that it exists: the planet likely has many mineral resources which we have not yet discovered. So to be defined as a reserve, we must have either a proved, probable or possible understanding of its existence. The second criteria relates to the economic feasibility of being able to access and extract the mineral resource. To be defined as a reserve, it must be economically and technologically viable to recover. If the economics are subeconomic (i.e. would result in a net loss) or marginal, a mineral resource is not defined as a reserve.</p><p>Whilst the original source of this concept - the American geologist Vincent McKelvey - visualised it as a static box, this transition between resources and reserve classifications is dynamic. As we discover previously unknown resources, and develop improved extraction technologies for economic recovery, this reserves box can grow with time (or shrink as we consume them).</p><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-15047" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-750x538.png" alt="Reserves vs. resources 01" width="868" height="623" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-150x108.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-400x287.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-750x538.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01-768x551.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reserves-vs.-Resources-01.png 12502w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h3 id="units-of-energy"><a class="deep-link" href="#units-of-energy"></a>Units of energy</h3><p>To maintain consistency between metrics and sources, we have attempted to normalise all energy data to units of watt-hours (Wh), or one of its SI prefixes.
