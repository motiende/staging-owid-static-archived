Substance use disorders include alcohol and all illicit drugs (whether prescribed or otherwise) including opioids, cocaine, amphetamine and cannabis. This classification does not include tobacco.</p><p>A definite diagnosis of dependence should usually be made only if three or more of the following have been present together at some time during the previous year:</p><ul>
<li>(a) a strong desire or sense of compulsion to take the substance;</li>
<li>(b) difficulties in controlling substance-taking behaviour in terms of its onset, termination, or levels of use;</li>
<li>(c) a physiological withdrawal state when substance use has ceased or been reduced, as evidenced by: the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance; or use of the same (or a closely related) substance with the intention of relieving or avoiding withdrawal symptoms;</li>
<li>(d) evidence of tolerance, such that increased doses of the psychoactive substance are required in order to achieve effects originally produced by lower doses (clear examples of this are found in alcohol- and opiate-dependent individuals who may take daily doses sufficient to incapacitate or kill nontolerant users);</li>
<li>(e) progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests because of psychoactive substance use, increased amount of time necessary to obtain or take the substance or to recover from its effects;</li>
<li>(f) persisting with substance use despite clear evidence of overtly harmful consequences, such as harm to the liver through excessive drinking, depressive mood states consequent to periods of heavy substance use, or drug-related impairment of cognitive functioning; efforts should be made to determine that the user was actually, or could be expected to be, aware of the nature and extent of the harm.</li>

This means around 1-in-20 suffers from substance dependency. Across Western and Central Europe, the Americas and Oceania, this prevalence typically ranges from 2-5 percent. Across Africa, the Middle East and Asia this prevalence is typically lower at 1-2 percent. When we look at gender differences in substance use disorders we see that in every country the prevalence is greater in men than women.</p><p>It&apos;s estimated that globally, around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-people-with-alcohol-or-drug-use-disorders?tab=map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">164 million people</a> had an alcohol or drug use disorder in 2016.

However, suicide deaths are also strongly linked&#xA0;&#x2014; although not always attributed to&#xA0;&#x2014; mental health and substance use disorders. We discuss the evidence of this link between mental health, substance use and suicide <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#link-between-mental-health-and-suicide">in our entry on Mental Health</a>. It&apos;s estimated that an individual with alcohol, opioid, or psychostimulant dependence has an increased risk of suicide of 10, 7 and 8, respectively relative to an individual without.

Although they should in many cases be treated differently, the range of risk factors &#x2013; from preconception through to old age &#x2013; described in our Mental Health entry are likely to also apply in cases of Substance Use disorder.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the risk factors uptake and addiction to a particular substance can vary across the stages of this process. In Kreek et al. (2005) the authors propose the relative contribution of different factors to drug initiation, regular use and addiction or relapse, in&#xA0;<em>Nature Neuroscience</em>.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>The authors suggest that the initiation of drug use is often most closely associated with impulsivity and risk-taking tendencies (which typically have a genetic component), in addition to particular environment factors. The transition from initiation to intermittent or regular use is based on the interplay of many factors including impulsivity, risk-taking tendencies, stress response and comorbidity in addition to environmental factors. Finally the transition from intermittent or regular use towards addiction and relapse are most strongly influenced by a mixture of stress response, environmental factors, genetic predisposition to addiction and importantly the drug-induced effects which often create a cycle of addiction and relapse.</p><p>A number of studies have found impulsivity and risk-taking traits to be a leading vulnerability factor in the development of a substance use disorder.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> Such characteristics are also often seen in individuals with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorders-adhd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</a> (ADHD). A number of studies have found a strong link between individuals with ADHD and increased risk of the onset of a substance use disorder.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,&#xA0;</sup><a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a><sup>,&#xA0;</sup><a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> The impulsivity trait of ADHD in particular is identified as an important vulnerability for later onset of substance use disorders.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> This does not infer that all individuals with ADHD will later develop a substance use disorder; however, studies suggest that there is an increased likelihood in individuals with ADHD relative to those without (as discussed below).</p><h4 id="mental-health-disorders-as-a-risk-factor-for-substance-dependency"><a class="deep-link" href="#mental-health-disorders-as-a-risk-factor-for-substance-dependency"></a>Mental health disorders as a risk factor for substance dependency</h4><p>It is known that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental health</a> and substance disorders can be closely related: the IHME often group these disorders together in a collective category when discussing related statistics. However, there is also significant evidence that individual mental health disorders, although to varying degrees, can increase the likelihood of an individual developing a substance use disorder relative to those without.</p><p>In the chart below we show results from a study conducted published by Swendsen et al. (2010).<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> In this study the authors followed a cohort of more than 5000 individuals, with and without a mental health disorder (but without a substance use disorder) over a 10-year period. Following the 10 year period they re-assessed such individuals for whether they had either a nicotine, alcohol or illicit drug dependency.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>The results in the chart below show the increased risk of developing an illicit drug use disorder (alcohol dependency results are shown in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption#mental-health-disorders-as-a-risk-factor-for-alcohol-dependency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alcohol Consumption</a>) for someone with a given mental health disorder (relative to those without). For example, a value of 5.2 for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) indicates an individual with ADHD would be more than 5 times as likely to develop an illicit drug dependency relative to someone without. The risk of a substance use disorder is highest in individuals with Intermittent explosive disorder, ADHD, and bipolar disorder.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mental-health-as-risk-for-drug-dependency" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mental-health-as-risk-for-drug-dependency" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/mental-health-as-risk-for-drug-dependency_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="alcohol-use-vs-drug-use-disorders"><a class="deep-link" href="#alcohol-use-vs-drug-use-disorders"></a>Alcohol use vs. drug use disorders</h3><p>Do countries with high rates of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption#alcohol-use-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcoholism</a> also have high rates of other drug use disorders? Or does a high prevalence in one mean a low prevalence in the other?</p><p>In the chart below we see the share of the population with alcohol dependency versus the share with a drug use disorder (not including alcohol or tobacco). As we see, there is no clear relationship between the two; whilst most countries have a higher prevalence of alcohol dependence relative to other drugs, this is not true for all countries. It is also the case that a given country having a high rate of alcoholism does not imply it also has high rates of other drug use disorders (or vice versa).</p><p>Overall we see two clear outliers: Russia has notably high rates of alcoholism, and the United States high prevalence of other drug addiction.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-alcohol-vs-drug-use-disorder" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-alcohol-vs-drug-use-disorder" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-with-alcohol-vs-drug-use-disorder_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="are-drug-use-disorders-more-common-in-young-people"><a class="deep-link" href="#are-drug-use-disorders-more-common-in-young-people"></a>Are drug use disorders more common in young people?</h3><p>There is often the perception that substance use is more common in young people. But does the data support this assumption?</p><p>In the chart below we see the prevalence of drug use disorders differentiated by age group, given as the percentage of people within that age bracket with a drug use dependency. Here the USA is shown, but this data can be found for any country using the &quot;change country&quot; button on the chart below.</p><p>Overall, we tend to find that the prevalence of drug use disorders is highest in people in their twenties. For example, in the USA, 9 percent of those aged 20-24 years old had a drug use disorder in 2016; this is several multiples higher than the total population average of 3 percent. The higher prevalence of substance use disorders in people in their twenties (or sometimes in their late teens) is consistent across most countries.</p><p>Is this finding a reflection of today&apos;s young generation, or has this been a historically consistent trend with age? In other words: is the prevalence in today&apos;s young cohort uncharacteristically high, or is it a recurring pattern that drug use increases through peoples&apos; late teens and early twenties before declining thereafter? It appears to be the latter. The finding that drug use disorders tend to be most common in people in their early twenties has been consistently reported for decades: studies dating back to the 1980s and 1990s attempt to explain why substance use tends to peak during this period.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> There are a number of related behavioural and social factors which may partly explain why this peaks in the early twenties. Initiation of alcohol or drug use tends to begin in the late teenage years, after which the following years represent a key period of self-identity, exploration and higher affinity for risk-taking.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> Such attributes, combined with social pressures can in many cases lead to more frequent substance use (and the potential for development into drug dependency).</p><p>Beyond the early twenties, the prevalence can often decline through means of selection and self-correction. A longitudinal study of young adults in the 1990s found that the impact of common aspirations such as marriage, parenthood and steady employment tend to result in a decline in substance use.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> The study suggests that by ages 28-31, individuals who were married and/or had children had much lower use of alcohol, cigarettes and illicit drugs (and lower perception of substance use in friends) than those without.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-drug-use-disorders-by-age?country=USA" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-drug-use-disorders-by-age?country=USA" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/prevalence-of-drug-use-disorders-by-age-799fb6381a576c562c2e541a79330d7d_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>





















<section><h2 id="data-quality-definitions-measurement"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definitions-measurement"></a>Data Quality, Definitions &amp; Measurement</h2><h3 id="data-availability-on-substance-use-disorders"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-availability-on-substance-use-disorders"></a>Data availability on substance use disorders</h3><p>The majority of data presented in this entry is based on estimates from the IHME&apos;s <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool">Global Burden of Disease</a> (GBD). This is currently one of the only sources which produces global level estimates across most countries on the prevalence and disease burden of mental health and substance use disorders.</p><p>Nonetheless, the GBD acknowledges the clear data gaps which exist on mental health prevalence across the world. Despite being the 5th largest disease burden at a global level (and with within the top three across many countries), detailed data is often lacking. This is particularly true of lower-income countries. The Global Burden of Disease note that the range of epidemiological studies they draw upon for global and national estimates are unequally distributed across disorders, age groups, countries and epidemiological parameters.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> Utilising these studies to provide full coverage of these disorders is challenging.</p><p>To overcome these methodological challenges the authors note:</p><blockquote><p>To deal with this issue and be able to include data derived using various study methodologies and designs, GBD 2013 makes use of DisMod-MR, version 2.0, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. The software makes it possible to pool all of the epidemiological data available for a given disorder into a weighted average, while simultaneously adjusting for known sources of variability in estimates reported across studies. If raw data are not available for a given country, the software produces an imputed estimate for each epidemiological parameter based on data available from surrounding countries. This allowed GBD to include estimates for 188 countries.</p></blockquote></section>
