The UN projections are called &apos;assessments&apos; and a new update is published in their <em>World Population Prospects</em> series every two years. The scenario which the UN researchers see as the most likely scenario is the Medium Variant projection. But in addition to their main Medium projection the UN Population Division are additionally publishing a High and Low variant, which simply assume that the total fertility rates are 0.5 higher and 0.5 lower than the Medium variant by the end of this century in every country.</p><p>But there are also a number of other institutions that are preparing their own projections of the world population. Global population projections are also published by the US Census, the Population Reference Bureau (PRB), and by the closely related Austrian research centers IIASA and the Wittgenstein Centre. The World Bank also published projections for some time but has stopped doing so in the mid&#x2013;90s.</p><h3 id="the-wc-iiasa-projections-how-investments-in-education-matter-for-the-global-population-in-the-21st-century"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-wc-iiasa-projections-how-investments-in-education-matter-for-the-global-population-in-the-21st-century"></a>The WC-IIASA projections: How investments in education matter for the global population in the 21st century</h3><p>A set of influential projections is published by IIASA and the Wittgenstein Centre, which I refer to as the WC-IIASA projections.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>Projections of the global population are uncertain and much of the uncertainty comes from the fact that we do not know which investments the world will make in those systems that determine mortality and fertility &#x2013; most importantly in education, as we have just seen.</p><p>The WC-IIASA projections differ from the work of the United Nations in a number of <a href="http://blog.iiasa.ac.at/2014/09/23/9-billion-or-11-billion-the-research-behind-new-population-projections/">fundamental ways</a>. The UN projections are taking into account the empirical data on each country&#x2019;s demography and are building projections based on this quantitative information. In contrast to this the WC-IIASA projections are also taking into account the qualitative assessments of 550 demographers from around the world which the WC-IIASA researchers have surveyed to gather their ideas on how the population change in different parts of the world will play out. They then combine the country specific expertise of these researchers with similar quantitative information that the UN and others rely on as well.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The work by WC-IIASA is highly respected among demographers and key publications by the researchers are regularly published in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>The WC-IIASA projections are taking into account the demographic structure of the educational attainment of the population. While other projections are only structuring the demographic data by sex and age-group, the WC-IIASA data is additionally breaking down the population data by the level of highest educational attainment of different parts of the population. This information on educational attainment is then used for both the output of the model &#x2013; so that population projections for each country of the world by highest educational attainment are available (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/projections-of-future-education/">also on Our World in Data</a>). And crucially the information on education is also used as an an input into the model, so that the impact of different future scenarios for education on both mortality and fertility can be modeled explicitly.</p><p>The level of highest educational attainment is categorized in a system that aims to capture the structure of populations across the different country-specific educational systems. These categorizations are based on the the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), which was designed by the UNESCO to make education statistics comparable across countries. WC-IIASA breaks down the educational structure into the following 6 categories and the table summarizes how the six categories are defined, how they correspond to ISCED 1997, and the main allocation rules the researchers used.</p><h6>Categories of educational attainment used by IIASA-WC and how they correspond to the ISCED levels<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Edu-Attainment-IIASA-WC.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13897" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Edu-Attainment-IIASA-WC-607x550.png" alt="" width="607" height="550"></a></p><p>For children younger than 15 years old no educational attainment information is available as most of them are still in the process of education.</p><h4 id="the-four-scenarios-for-global-education-by-wc-iiasa"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-four-scenarios-for-global-education-by-wc-iiasa"></a>The four scenarios for global education by WC-IIASA</h4><p>Projections of the global population take into account how the fertility rate will change in each country over the coming decades. The WC-IIASA projections are particularly helpful for the discussion here as they are the only projections that break down the demographic projections by the educational level of the populations and then model how different educational scenarios would affect the fertility rate in countries across the world. This then allows comparisons of how education matters for the size and distribution of the future population of the planet.</p><p>The researchers developed 4 different basic scenarios and a larger number of combinations based on these scenarios:</p><p><strong>Constant Enrollment Numbers (CEN):</strong> This is the researcher&apos;s most pessimistic scenario. Here it is assumed that no more schools are being opened in any place in the world so that the absolute number of people reaching a particular educational level is frozen at the current number. This means that enrollment rates are declining when the population size increases.</p><p>In practice the WC-IIASA researchers almost always consider CER as the most pessimistic scenario and only rarely discuss CEN.</p><p><strong>Constant Enrollment Rates (CER)</strong>: This is another pessimistic scenario. While in the CEN scenario the absolute <em>number</em>&#xA0;of enrolled students stagnates, the assumption in the CER scenario is that the <em>rate </em>of enrollment stagnates. In this scenario the most recently observed rates of educational enrollment are frozen at their current rate and no further improvement in enrollment is assumed.</p><p>This will still result in further improvements of adult education because in many countries the younger cohorts are better educated than the older ones. But in the longer run this scenario also implies stagnation.</p><p><strong>Fast Track (FT):</strong> This scenario is the most optimistic one and here it is assumed that countries follow the most rapid education expansion achieved in recent history which is that of South Korea.</p><p><strong>Global Education Trend (GET):</strong> This is the middle scenario and here the researchers assume that countries will follow the average path of educational expansion that other countries already further advanced in this process have experienced.&#xA0;In this scenario the researchers project the medium future trajectory based on the experience of all countries over the past 40 years</p><p>The researchers write:&#xA0;&#x201C;The GET scenario is moderately optimistic, and can be considered as the most likely.&#x201D;<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><h3 id="the-track-record-of-the-un-projections"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-track-record-of-the-un-projections"></a>The track record of the UN projections</h3><h4 id="global-population-growth"><a class="deep-link" href="#global-population-growth"></a>Global population growth</h4><p>In a 2001 paper, Nico Keilman assessed the projections of the global demographic changes that the UN published between 1951 and 1998.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> The next graph shows the increase of the world population (solid black line) along with the UN projections published between 1950 and 1980.
