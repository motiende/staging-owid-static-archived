<section><h2 id="human-nature-and-pessimism"><a class="deep-link" href="#human-nature-and-pessimism"></a>Human nature and pessimism</h2><h3 id="individual-optimism-and-social-pessimism"><a class="deep-link" href="#individual-optimism-and-social-pessimism"></a>Individual Optimism and Social Pessimism</h3><p>It is a peculiar empirical phenomenon that while people tend to be optimistic about their own future, they can at the same time be deeply pessimistic about the future of their nation or the world. Tali Sharot, associate professor of psychology at UCL, has popularised the idea of an innate optimism bias built into the human brain.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> That is, we tend to be optimistic rather than realistic when considering our individual future. If you were to ask newlywed couples to estimate the probability they will divorce in the future, they would likely reject the possibility outright. Yet today roughly 40% of marriages in the UK end in divorce. Another example is asking smokers to estimate their chances of getting cancer and again, most would underestimate their risk. This optimism persists even when people are presented with the relevant statistics.</p><p>Consider the following graphs from the European Union&apos;s Eurobarometer surveys; they report people&apos;s expectations about their own personal job situation and of the economic situation in their home country. From the end of 1995 to the middle of 2015, around 60% of people predict that their job situation will remain the same, while 20% expect their situation to improve. Compare that with the response of the same group of individuals considering the future of the economic situation in their home country. Although far less stable, the results show that most people expect the economic situation in their home country to get worse or stay the same. The expectation that things are going to worsen nationally is correlated with recessions, yet there is remarkable stability in the results for individual expectations. Does the response to the question about national economic well being better correspond to an individual&apos;s true job prospects?</p><h6>EU survey responses on individual and economic optimism - Eurobarometer surveys<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6393" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism-750x281.png" alt="EU survey responses on optimism" width="750" height="281" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism-150x56.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism-400x150.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism-750x281.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_eu-survey-responses-on-optimism.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="we-are-local-optimists-and-national-pessimists-in-politics"><a class="deep-link" href="#we-are-local-optimists-and-national-pessimists-in-politics"></a>We are local optimists and national pessimists &#x2013; in politics</h4><p>This pattern is also observed on a larger scale.

</h6><h4 id="why-are-we-social-pessimists"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-are-we-social-pessimists"></a>Why are we social pessimists?</h4><p>How can we reconcile this individual optimism with social pessimism? Paul Dolan, professor of behavioural science at LSE, believes people respond pessimistically to questions about national or international performance for three reasons:</p><ol style="font-size: medium; text-align: left; font-family: sans-serif;">
<li>Individuals rarely think about grand issues such as the state of the nation or world, and so respond with an &apos;on-the-spot&apos; answer that may not be well considered or even a true reflection of their beliefs.</li>
<li>The framing can influence the individual&apos;s response. Moreover, the question itself may bias responses; &apos;who would bother to ask if everything were okay?&apos;</li>
<li>Responses to questions such as these (and more general questions about happiness or life satisfaction) are heavily influenced by ephemeral recent events. In psychology this is referred to as the &apos;availability bias&apos;.</li>
</ol><p>This explanation suggests there is a problem of information. If we do not pay attention to human development, then our judgement may suffer from a bias related to transient events or framing. <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/ignorance/" target="_blank">The Gapminder Ignorance Project</a>&#xA0;&#x2013; which studied how wrong or right people are informed about global development &#x2013; suggests the reason for all this ignorance is:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Statistical facts don&#x2019;t come to people naturally. Quite the opposite. Most people understand the world by generalizing personal experiences which are very biased. In the media the &#x201C;news-worthy&#x201D; events exaggerate the unusual and put the focus on swift changes. Slow and steady changes in major trends don&#x2019;t get much attention. Unintentionally, people end-up carrying around a sack of outdated facts that you got in school (including knowledge that often was outdated when acquired in school).&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Another explanation put forward by Martin Seligman, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, suggests a link between control and optimism. If we feel more in control of our lives, we tend to be happier, healthier and more optimistic about the future. This could also help to explain the gap between individual and societal optimism: since we are in direct control of our own lives but not the destiny of the nation we feel more optimistic about ourselves.</p><h3 id="information-matters-we-are-not-only-pessimistic-about-the-future-we-are-also-unaware-of-past-improvements"><a class="deep-link" href="#information-matters-we-are-not-only-pessimistic-about-the-future-we-are-also-unaware-of-past-improvements"></a>Information matters: We are not only pessimistic about the future, we&#xA0;are also&#xA0;unaware of past improvements</h3><h4 id="we-are-unaware-of-the-decline-of-violence"><a class="deep-link" href="#we-are-unaware-of-the-decline-of-violence"></a>We are unaware of the decline of violence</h4><p>The psychological considerations before suggest that the lack of information is key to understanding why we are largely biased to think negatively about society and how things are changing.

Declinism was a prevalent feature of British political and economic history, whereby the decline of Britain as a world power was seen as the result of internal failures rather than international forces or global convergence. David Edgerton writes: &quot;Declinism is beginning to appear as one of the last vestiges of imperial grandeur: for declinism holds, implicitly but clearly, that if Britain had done better it would have remained a much larger player on the world stage.&quot;<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> Today declinism in the United States is fashionable with many politicians. Donald Trump&apos;s campaign slogan for the 2016 Republican nomination election was&#xA0;&quot;Make America Great Again!&quot;</p><p>The major flaw in much of the declinist narrative is the failure to distinguish between absolute and relative changes. Between 2010-14, US real GDP growth rates have fluctuated between 1.5-2.5% and yet, the US economy was recently overtaken by the Chinese economy measured in PPP-adjusted terms.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> In many ways this may capture the reason why the most developed nations tend to believe that their economy is in decline: relative decline is interpreted as absolute decline. Unsurprisingly, new EU member states tend to be much more optimistic about the future. The four largest economies -- the UK, France, Germany and Italy -- are the most pessimistic. This pattern persists when considering economies at different stages of development: developing countries are more optimistic about the future, while developed ones tend to be pessimistic.</p><h6>Optimism about the future of the next generation by country - Pew Research Center<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6397" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country-208x550.png" alt="Optimism surveys on the next generation by country" width="208" height="550" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country-57x150.png 57w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country-151x400.png 151w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country-208x550.png 208w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_optimism-surveys-on-the-next-generation-by-country.png 309w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="declinism-and-age-the-reminiscence-bump"><a class="deep-link" href="#declinism-and-age-the-reminiscence-bump"></a>Declinism and Age: The Reminiscence Bump</h4><p>One interesting explanation for declinism is that it is the result of the way we encode memories and what we remember. Firstly, researchers have long established a robust pattern in the age at which we retain the most memories. In old age, memories from our lives are not evenly distributed but instead concentrated in two regions. These regions are (1) memories formed in adolescence and early adulthood, between the ages of 10-30, and (2) recent memory of events. The following figure is a useful representation of this distribution.</p><h6>Lifespan memory retrieval curve - Wikipedia<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6403" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve.jpg" alt="Lifespan Retrieval Curve" width="531" height="374" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve-32x32.jpg 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve-64x64.jpg 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve-96x96.jpg 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve-128x128.jpg 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve-150x106.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve-400x282.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_lifespan-retrieval-curve.jpg 531w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p>Secondly, research finds that as we get older we tend to have &#x2013; on average &#x2013; fewer negative experiences and that we are more likely to remember the positive ones over the negative ones.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> This effect combined with the reminiscence bump could explain why declinism exists among older generations, and why your parents could never stand the music you listened to!

In the history of modern English there is no period in which such victory over thought-in-speech has been so widespread. Nor in the past has the general idiom, on which we depend for our very understanding of vital matters, been so seriously distorted.&quot; (A. Tibbets and C.

<section><h2 id="why-does-realism-matter"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-does-realism-matter"></a>Why&#xA0;does realism matter?</h2><p>There are three main reasons we should try to combat social pessimism and declinism. The first reason is simple; indicators of living standards are significantly improving around the world. By monitoring and researching these changes we can identify ways in which progress can be achieved. Over the long-run, say 50-100 years, human progress has been staggering with the benefits not confined to the richest or most powerful. The second reason is that if our perceptions of the reality are wrong, we can end up prioritising the wrong things and making ineffectual change. Finally, being optimistic can be good for your health, while having a pessimistic outlook can be detrimental to your health.</p><h3 id="perception-and-priority"><a class="deep-link" href="#perception-and-priority"></a>Perception and Priority</h3><p>The public perception of these indicators matters because it directly influences the priorities of voters in democratic countries and politicians. If, as in the example above, the public believes crime is increasing, it is likely that it&#xA0;demands more policing not for a reason grounded in reality, but for an imagined worsening of the society they live it.&#xA0;This is&#xA0;one reason why incorrect public perceptions can be a problem.</p><p>The following figures underline just how sizable these effects can be. The first shows how spending on crime has moved with the public&apos;s confidence in the government&apos;s ability to crack down on crime. As the public&apos;s confidence fell, spending on crime increased and recorded crime fell; without any uptick in the public&apos;s confidence.</p><h6>Public confidence, recorded crime and government spending in the UK, 1997-2007 - Ipsos MORI (2008)<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-6437" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori-750x502.png" alt="Spending on crime, crime levels and public confidence - Ipsos MORI" width="750" height="502" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori-150x100.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori-400x268.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori-750x502.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ourworldindata_spending-on-crime-crime-levels-and-public-confidence-ipsos-mori.png 1157w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="the-media-matters-for-pessimism"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-media-matters-for-pessimism"></a>The media matters for pessimism</h4><p>One contributing factor to&#xA0;some of the widespread misinformation&#xA0;seems to be the content consumed through media channels.</p><p>Of those who believed crime was increasing, more than half suggested that information on TV was a reason they believed there was more crime.
