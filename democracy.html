Two centuries ago, most countries were autocracies or colonies; today, most are democracies. In the map and chart below, each country receives a Polity IV score, which goes from &#x2212;10 (full autocracy) to 10 (full democracy). For convenience, in this entry, we&apos;ll refer to this as the &quot;Democracy Score&quot;. By default, 2015 data are shown, but you can move the slider (bottom) to see data in each of the past 200 years.</p><p>Most countries in Europe and the Americas are now democracies. Some parts of Africa &#x2014; especially in the West and the South &#x2014; have democratized. So too have countries in Asia, with India being the world&apos;s largest democracy. Many countries are full democracies (score of 10), including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Mongolia.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/political-regime-updated2016" class="grapherPreview">

For example, we have just seen that good health is correlated with democratization. But is it good health that leads to democratization? Or is it democratization that leads to good health? Or perhaps it is neither &#x2014; the correlation is simply spurious? Most often though, it is a little of all of the above. When presented with a correlation between variables X and Y, social scientists are faced with the task of quantifying the degree to which X causes Y, Y causes X, or neither.</p><p>We now briefly examine one possible determinant of democratization: education.</p><h4 id="countries-with-better-education-in-the-past-are-more-likely-to-be-democracies-today"><a class="deep-link" href="#countries-with-better-education-in-the-past-are-more-likely-to-be-democracies-today"></a>Countries with better education in the past are more likely to be democracies today</h4><p>A long-standing theory in political science argues that education is a key determinant of the emergence and sustainability of democracy, because it promotes political participation at the individual level and fosters a collective sense of civic duty.</p><p>And so, under this theory, we should expect that education correlates positively with measures of democratization in subsequent years. This is precisely what we see in the data and chart below. Those countries that had higher average education levels in 1970 are also those countries that are more likely to be democratic today (you can read more about measures of education level in our entry on <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/global-rise-of-education">Global Rise of Education</a>).</p><p>Again, these data should be interpreted carefully. They merely show a correlation and do not imply a causal link. That is, these data do not imply that education leads to democracy.</p><p>Nonetheless, academic work does suggest that there is such a causal link. Even after controlling for many other country characteristics, the positive relationship between education and democracy holds (see, for example, Lutz, Crespo-Cuaresma, and Abbasi&#x2010;Shavazi 2010<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a>).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/correlation-between-education-and-democracy-1" class="grapherPreview">

Once again, this is a tricky question for social science, because we need to distinguish between the two arrows of causation.</p><p><strong>Evidence that democratization leads to better education</strong></p><p>Gallego (2010)<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> presents the most careful analysis that we are aware of. It presents evidence&#xA0;that democracy has&#xA0;indeed had a causal effect on primary-school enrollment.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Other papers deal with the issue of possible reverse causality in a simpler fashion and use lagged observations of democracy as a possible determinant for the level of education.&#xA0;For example, Baum and Lake (2001)&#xA0;find that democratization increased&#xA0;secondary-school enrollment.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>Also, Acemoglu, Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2015)<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a>&#xA0;find that democracy is associated with an increase in secondary schooling.</p><p>We now briefly discuss several channels through which democratization might improve education:</p><p><strong>Electoral competition in democracies&#xA0;increases the incentive to abolish school fees</strong></p><p>Harding and Stasavage (2014)<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> find that democratization has a positive effect on primary education. Their explanation is that electoral competition&#xA0;in democracies incentivizes politicians to&#xA0;abolish primary-school fees. They argue that democratization has&#xA0;a much smaller effect on the provision&#xA0;of school inputs and consequently the quality of schooling &#x2014; the reason is that such actions are harder to monitor and would thus provide politicians with a smaller&#xA0;advantage in electoral competition.</p><p><strong>Democratization increases&#xA0;educational spending</strong></p><p>Stasvage (2005)<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a> finds that the 1990s shift to multiparty competition in African countries increased total educational spending as a percentage of GDP.</p><p>Ansell (2010)<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> studies 100 countries over 40 years and finds that democratization increases both&#xA0;total educational spending as a share&#xA0;of GDP and as a share&#xA0;of the government budget.</p><p><strong>Evidence that democracy improves&#xA0;teacher&#x2013;student ratios</strong></p><p>Naidu (2011)<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> studies the effects of the 19th-century disenfranchisement of black citizens in the US South through&#xA0;poll taxes and literacy tests. He finds that this reversal of democracy&#xA0;&quot;reduced the teacher-child ratio in black schools by 10&#x2013;23%, with no significant effects on white teacher-child ratios.&quot;</p><p><strong>Democracy improved local politics in China and lead to more educated politicians</strong></p><p>Martinez-Bravo et al. (2012)<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> study the gradual introduction of&#xA0;local elections in China. In particular, they exploit the staggered timing of&#xA0;the introduction of village elections as a natural experiment. They &quot;find that elections significantly increase public goods expenditure, the increase corresponds to demand and is paralleled by an increase in public goods provision and local taxes.&quot; This is consistent with some of the results we&apos;ve already discussed, including increased&#xA0;public education in villages with more children. Overall total public goods investment increased by 27 percent &#x2013; this increase in public expenditures was funded by villagers&#xA0;and was accompanied by an increase in the local taxes paid by villagers.</p><p>The introduction of elections also reduced inequality. This was achieved partly through (a) land redistribution from&#xA0;elite-controlled enterprises to farming households; and (b) increased irrigation and hence improved agricultural productivity that is likely to &quot;disproportionately benefit poorer households&quot;.</p><p>Martinez-Bravo et al. (2012) also find that the introduction of elections was followed by the increased turnover of village chairmen increased. Moreover, the village chairmen were now less likely to be Communist Party members and, more importantly, were better&#xA0;educated.</p></section>















































<section><h2 id="data-quality-definition"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definition"></a>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2><h3 id="why-we-chose-polity-iv-as-the-main-source-for-democracy-measures"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-we-chose-polity-iv-as-the-main-source-for-democracy-measures"></a>Why we chose Polity IV as the main source for democracy measures</h3><p>Measuring democratization is a tricky business. Can something as complex as democratization really be boiled down to a single, one-dimensional metric? Many would argue that it cannot.</p><p>Nonetheless, such a metric can be convenient and useful &#x2014; it allows us to compare political regimes across time and space, and to quantify the causes and effects of political regime change. For example, such a metric can help us study the link between democratization and the end of mass <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/famines/">famines</a>.</p><p>In this entry, we have chosen to rely heavily on Polity IV and, in particular, what we&apos;ve called the Democracy Score as our metric for democratization. One reason for choosing Polity IV is its long-run perspective.</p><p>Another is that Polity IV&apos;s data sources provide a detailed explanation for each country&apos;s political regime classification in each year. You can find these explanations in the PDF files <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/">here</a>.</p><p>Yet another reason for choosing Polity IV is that it was praised by Munck and Verkuilen (2002),<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> which is a a much-cited and thorough evaluation of commonly used democracy measures. These authors argue that there is usually a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of the empirical scope and the quality of the assessment in terms of conceptualization, measurement, and aggregation. However, Polity IV constitutes a rare &quot;partial exception&quot; to this trade-off.</p><p>Of course, we must keep in mind that the Polity IV Democracy Score does not and cannot capture everything that matters. For example, it fails to capture corruption or <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/human-rights/">human rights</a> adequately &#x2014; and in any case, it probably makes better sense for us to measure these separately.</p><h3 id="comparison-of-different-regime-measures"><a class="deep-link" href="#comparison-of-different-regime-measures"></a>Comparison of different regime measures</h3><p>The chart below is taken from Wilhelmsen (2006)<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>It puts together three other measures of democratization that we haven&apos;t yet discussed in this entry. These are the Polyarchy measure, the Polity measure, and the Freedom House measure. The Polyarchy and Polity measures go back to the early 19th century. The Freedom House measure shows the percentage of independent countries that are democratic. You can see that while these measures do not exactly coincide, they do largely move together.</p><h6>Share of democracies of independent countries, 1816&#x2013;2002 &#x2013; Wilhelmsen<a title href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-690" title src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png.png" alt="Share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816&#x2013;2002-Wilhelmsen.png" width="600" height="382" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png-300x191.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png.png 600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></h6></section>
