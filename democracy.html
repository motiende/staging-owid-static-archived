By clicking on &apos;Autocracies&apos; and &apos;Anocracies&apos;, you can also see that after 1989 the number of autocracies has decreased dramatically while the number of anocracies initially increased then has stayed fairly stable.</p><h6>Number of democracies between 1800-2010<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

Therefore it is more interesting to look at the number of people governed by different political regimes. This is shown in the chart below.</p><p>By clicking on &apos;Relative&apos;, the following graph shows the share of people living in different regimes over the last two centuries.</p><p>The chart shows the share of people living under different types of political regimes over the last 2 centuries. Throughout the 19th century more than a third of the population lived in in countries that were colonized by imperial powers and almost everyone else lived in autocratically ruled countries. The first expansion of political freedom from the late 19th century onward was crushed by the rise of authoritarian regimes that in many countries took their place in the time leading up to the Second World War.</p><p>In the second half of the 20th century the world has changed significantly: <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/colonialism/">Colonial empires ended</a>, and more and more countries turned democratic: The share of the world population living in democracies increased continuously &#x2013; particularly important was the breakdown of the Soviet Union which allowed more countries to democratise. Now more than every second person in the world lives in a democracy.</p><p>We see the same data on political regimes on&#xA0;the map&#xA0;below, but it is worth pointing out that 4 out of 5 people in the world that live in an autocracy live in China.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-pop-by-political-regime" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-pop-by-political-regime" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/world-pop-by-political-regime_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="world-maps-of-political-regimes-over-200-years"><a class="deep-link" href="#world-maps-of-political-regimes-over-200-years"></a>World maps of political regimes over 200 years</h3><p>The world has changed: 2 centuries ago most countries were autocratically ruled or part of a colonial empire, today most countries are democracies. The map below shows the data for 2015, but you can move the slider at the bottom past to see this change over the last 2 centuries.</p><p>Most countries in Europe and the Americas have become democracies. Some parts of Africa - especially in the West and the South - have democratized and so have countries in Asia; India is the world&apos;s largest democracy. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Mongolia are all full democracies according to the Polity IV evaluation.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/political-regime-updated2016" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/political-regime-updated2016" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/political-regime-updated2016_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="political-freedom-is-a-very-recent-achievement"><a class="deep-link" href="#political-freedom-is-a-very-recent-achievement"></a>Political freedom is a very recent achievement</h3><p>The following world map&#xA0;of the age of democratic regimes&#xA0;shows that a democratic world is only a very recent achievement. It also indicates that economic success goes together with political liberation. The countries that have democratized first are mostly those countries that first achieved economic growth. The present rates of economic growth in the poorer countries of the world therefore give hope for further democratization around the world.</p><h6>World map of the age of democratic regimes - years before 2007 since the (last) transition to a democratic regime<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

No country that is an autocracy (score between -10 and -6) has an income of more than 15,000 international-$ if it is not heavily dependent on fossil-fuel exports.

Few autocratic countries achieved a child mortality below 10 per 1,000. Democratic countries &#x2013;&#xA0;Polity score of 7 or higher &#x2013; on the other hand often have child mortality rates below 10 or even 5 per 1,000.</p><p>This cross section at one point in time does not tell us anything about the length of time that a country was ruled by a democratic government &#x2013; for this we have to study the link between democratisation and health in more detail and more carefully.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-vs-type-of-political-regime" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/child-mortality-vs-type-of-political-regime" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/child-mortality-vs-type-of-political-regime_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="determinants-of-democratisation"><a class="deep-link" href="#determinants-of-democratisation"></a>Determinants of democratisation</h3><p>It is difficult to identify what causes countries to turn democratic and vice versa that is investigating how living conditions change in countries that turn democratic. The reason why social science gets so very difficult is that all good things tend to come together. We have just seen that in the preceding correlates section &#x2013; democratic countries are richer, healthier, happier, better educated and more. This means that if we study measures of all these aspects across countries we find a correlation between all of them; social scientists therefore use clever methods when trying to distinguish between correlation and causation.</p><h4 id="countries-with-higher-educational-attainment-in-the-past-are-more-likely-to-have-democratic-political-regimes-today"><a class="deep-link" href="#countries-with-higher-educational-attainment-in-the-past-are-more-likely-to-have-democratic-political-regimes-today"></a>Countries with higher educational attainment in the past are more likely to have democratic political regimes today</h4><p>A long-standing theory in political science stipulates that a country&apos;s level of education attainment is a key determinant of the emergence and sustainability of democratic political institutions, both because it promotes political participation at the individual level, and because it fosters a collective sense of civic duty.</p><p>Under this hypothesis, therefore, we should expect that education levels in a country correlate positively with measures of democratisation in subsequent years. The following visualization shows that this positive correlation is indeed supported by the data. As we can see, countries where adults had a higher average education level in 1970, are also more likely to have democratic political regimes today&#xA0;(you can read more about measures of education level in our entry on <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/global-rise-of-education">Global Rise of Education</a>).</p><p>As usual, these results should be interpreted carefully, because they do not imply a causal link: it does not prove that increasing education necessarily produces democratic outcomes everywhere in the world.</p><p>However, the academic research here does suggest that there is a causal link between education and democratization &#x2013; indeed, a number of empirical academic papers have found that this positive relationship remains after controlling for many other country characteristics (see, for example, Lutz, Crespo-Cuaresma, and Abbasi&#x2010;Shavazi 2010<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a>).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/correlation-between-education-and-democracy" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/correlation-between-education-and-democracy" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/correlation-between-education-and-democracy_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="consequences-of-democratic-rule"><a class="deep-link" href="#consequences-of-democratic-rule"></a>Consequences of democratic rule</h3><h4 id="human-rights-are-better-protected-in-democratic-countries"><a class="deep-link" href="#human-rights-are-better-protected-in-democratic-countries"></a>Human rights are better protected in democratic countries</h4><p>In considering the link between the&#xA0;type of political regime and the protection of human rights it is important to note that the right to vote on those in political power is in itself a fundamental right. In this sense&#xA0;democratic countries are by definition those countries in which this important dimension of human rights is protected.</p><p>But&#xA0;there are several human rights and it is&#xA0;interesting to study the link between&#xA0;democracy and these. As we note in our <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/human-rights/">entry on human rights</a> it is however very difficult to measure human rights protections consistently. The best available human rights measure is the&#xA0;protection score published by political scientist Christopher J. Fariss in Farriss (2014)<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a>. This measure focusses on the protection of the physical integrity of citizens&#xA0;and captures&#xA0;whether&#xA0;a government protects the physical integrity of its citizens and takes into account&#xA0;torture, government killing, political imprisonment, extrajudicial executions, mass killings and disappearances. Higher human rights scores indicate better human rights protection.</p><p>The visualisation below plots&#xA0;the regime type &#x2013; again captured by&#xA0;the Polity IV&#xA0;measure as before &#x2013; against this&#xA0;human rights&#xA0;protection score.</p><p>Political regime scores of 6 and above indicate a democratic regime and we see from this chart that citizens of non-democratic countries have generally much lower chances of being governed&#xA0;by a regime that ensures the protection of&#xA0;human rights in this dimension.&#xA0;With the exception of two countries &#x2013; Singapore and Oman &#x2013; all countries that&#xA0;have human rights score of higher than 0.5 are democratic regimes.</p><p class="p1">Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin (2004)<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a>&#xA0;investigate the link between democratic rule and the protection of human rights in a sample of 121 counties controlling for other important variables.

The authors caution that democratisation has&#xA0;a much small effect on the provision&#xA0;of school inputs and consequently the quality of schooling, because executive actions on these issues are more difficult to monitor and therefore&#xA0;constitute a smaller&#xA0;advantage to politicians in electoral competition.</p><p><strong>Democratisation increases&#xA0;educational spending</strong></p><p>In an earlier paper Stasvage (2005)<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> focussed on Africa and&#xA0;finds that the shift to multiparty competition in African countries in the 1990s&#xA0;increased total educational spending as a percentage of GDP.</p><p>In an extensive study of 100 countries over 40 years Ansell (2010)<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> presents evidence that democratisation increases both&#xA0;total educational spending as a share&#xA0;of GDP and as a share&#xA0;of the government budget.</p><p><strong>Evidence that democracy improves&#xA0;teacher&#x2013;student ratios</strong></p><p>Naidu (2011)<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> studies the effect of the 19th century disenfranchisement of black citizens in the U.S. South through&#xA0;poll taxes and literacy tests.

<section><h2 id="data-quality-definition"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definition"></a>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2><h3 id="why-we-chose-the-polity-iv-as-the-main-source-for-democracy-measures"><a class="deep-link" href="#why-we-chose-the-polity-iv-as-the-main-source-for-democracy-measures"></a>Why we chose the Polity IV as the main source for democracy measures</h3><p>It is necessarily controversial to measure a complex concept such as <span class="il">the type of a political regime</span> in a single metric. But since it can be useful to quantify the political regime characteristics so that it is possible to compare political regimes over time and between countries and to study the drivers and consequences of political regime change quantitatively. For example a field of study where this can be useful is studying the link between democratisation and the end of mass <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/famines/">famines</a>.</p><p>A much cited, thorough evaluation of commonly used democracy measures has been presented by Munck and Verkuilen (2002).<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> Unfortunately the authors find a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of the empirical scope and the quality of the assessment in terms of conceptualization, measurement and aggregation. According to the authors, the Polity IV measures are a &apos;partial exception&apos; of this tradeoff, and therefore I rely on these measures mostly in this entry. In general, the Polity IV defines democracy as a system which has institutions in which citizens can express their preferences, has constraints on the power of the executive, and a guarantee of civil liberties. It defines an autocracy as a system that restricts political participation by citizens, has executives chosen within the political elite, and executives with few institutional constraints.</p><p>The Polity IV measure used here is certainly also questionable &#x2013; as would every other alternative &#x2013; but we chose it as my main source because based on our comparison with alternatives and the paper by Munck and Verkuilen (2002) it is the best available option, particularly if a long-run perspective is the main objective.</p><p>We also have to keep in mind that this measure cannot capture everything that matters for a political regime. For example it makes sense to <span class="il">measure</span> corruption or <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/human-rights/">human rights</a> separately from the <span class="il">democracy</span> concept. Not because it doesn&apos;t matter but because all aspects matter and for different question we want to be able to differentiate between the importance of different factors.</p><div></div><div>Particularly good about the Polity IV measures is that the data source has a detailed explanation for each country why a country was classified in a particular way in a particular year: You find these country by country explanations in the pdf files <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/">here</a>.</div><h3 id="comparison-of-different-regime-measures"><a class="deep-link" href="#comparison-of-different-regime-measures"></a>Comparison of different regime measures</h3><p>This graph compares the political regime measures that are available for a very long time - since the early 19th century: the Polyarchy measure and the Polity measure and for a shorter period the the Freedom House measure. Shown is the share of democratic countries among all independent countries. There are some differences but the graphs shows they largely move together.</p><h6>Share of democracies of independent countries, 1816&#x2013;2002 &#x2013; Wilhelmsen<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> <a title="" href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-690" title="" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png.png" alt="Share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816&#x2013;2002-Wilhelmsen.png" width="600" height="382" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png-300x191.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/03/share-of-democracies-in-the-world-1816-2002-wilhelmsen-png.png 600w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a>
