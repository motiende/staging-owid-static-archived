These skills are increasingly necessary for life in the modern world, and are essential to the functioning of developed economies. For this reason, primary education is compulsory and provided by the state in almost all countries around the world. The second United Nations Millennium Development Goal was to &quot;ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling.&quot; This goal was missed but significant progress has been made. In 1970, 28% of primary-school-age children in the world were not attending school, today this share has decline to 9% -- equivalent to 60 million children not in primary education as the first visualization below shows.</p></section>

Although schools and religious institutions existed long before the 19th century, education was not compulsory and, in the majority of cases, costly. What is more, the value of a child&apos;s labour meant that only the richest families could afford to educate their children, a phenomenon that still exists in many developing countries today.</p><h3 id="the-rise-of-basic-schooling-over-the-last-2-centuries"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-rise-of-basic-schooling-over-the-last-2-centuries"></a>The rise of basic schooling over the last 2 centuries</h3><p>The chart shows the global development of attainment of at least some basic education. The estimates from the OECD and the IIASA institute show for the global population older than 15 years the share that has not received any formal education. In 1820 this was the huge majority of the world: More than 4 out 5 people alive then had not received any formal education. Over the last 2 centuries this turned around completely and today fewer than 1 out of 5 have received no education at all.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-world-population-with-at-least-basic-education" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-world-population-with-at-least-basic-education" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-of-the-world-population-with-at-least-basic-education_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="the-rise-of-basic-schooling-since-the-19th-century"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-rise-of-basic-schooling-since-the-19th-century"></a>The Rise of Basic Schooling since the 19th Century</h3><p>The earliest universal primary education system was established in Prussia by Frederick William in 1717.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> It was greatly expanded during the first half of the 19th Century and later copied by other European nations and the US. While many countries followed suit during the 20th century, others have been much slower at adopting the model of universal education.

<section><h2 id="correlates-determinants-consequences"><a class="deep-link" href="#correlates-determinants-consequences"></a>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2><h3 id="primary-education-and-growth"><a class="deep-link" href="#primary-education-and-growth"></a>Primary Education and Growth</h3><p>The economics literature has long studied whether the level of education in a country is a determinant of economic growth. Indeed, a number of studies have found that education in the form of cognitive skills &#x2013;rather than mere school attainment&#x2013; matters for predicting individual earnings and economic growth. You can read more about this in our related post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#education-outcomes-predict-economic-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p><!--</p>
<p>The correlation between schooling and growth has long been recognised. Countries with higher rates of education also tend to be more developed economies. For more information on the link between education and development, click <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education/#correlates-determinants-consequences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Richard Easterlin writing in 1981 highlighted the importance of universal schooling and economic development.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> His argument rests on the observation that "in the United States and Germany [the] development of widespread formal schooling preceded the onset of modern economic growth." Furthermore, Easterlin argues that mass (primary) schooling of a "secular and rationalistic type" is the most conducive to economic growth and not simply just education of the elite:</p>
<blockquote><p>Raising productivity levels involves active participation in new production methods by large numbers of the population—by workers in agriculture, industry, transportation, and so on. This is not to say that secondary and higher education can be ignored; clearly one needs technologists as well as mass education. But increases at higher levels of education typically go together with the expansion of primary education. On the other hand, education of the elite without mass education is unlikely to foster economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Easterlin suggests that the focus on educating the elite at the expense of the masses in the Ottoman Empire may have contributed to its decline. He also points out that while Spain had relatively high levels of primary education, it was tightly controlled by the Catholic Church and did not teach science, mathematics or other subjects that constitute a modern elementary education. For this reason, by 1900 almost two-thirds of Spain's population remained illiterate</p>

<p>--></p><h3 id="religion-schooling-and-growth"><a class="deep-link" href="#religion-schooling-and-growth"></a>Religion, Schooling and Growth</h3><p>The debate surrounding the link between religion and growth has an interesting history. Max Weber writing in the early 20th Century argued that it was the protestant work ethic that fostered the spirit of capitalism. However, recent empirical tests of this theory have rejected it.</p><p>Sascha O. Becker and Ludger Woessmann conducted an empirical test of Weber&apos;s hypothesis in Prussia.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> They conclude that while economic performance was indeed higher in protestant regions, so too was literacy, which explains the gap in economic performance. In particular, &quot;protestant economies prospered because instruction in reading the Bible generated the human capital crucial to economic prosperity.&quot; For more information on literacy, click <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h3 id="returns-to-education"><a class="deep-link" href="#returns-to-education"></a>Returns to Education</h3><p>Cross-country estimates of the return to education have found that the highest returns come from primary schooling. The most comprehensive work by George Psacharopoulos finds that the rate of return on primary education to an individual is 26.6%, highlighting the enormous benefits of basic education.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> However, disaggregating the results reveals that for less developed countries this is broadly true, but that in the developed world, the returns to higher education tend to be greater than for primary education.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> This pattern could be explained by the heterogeneous labour market conditions around the world, in particular, the supply of skilled and unskilled labour.

<li><strong>Net Enrollment Ratio (NER)</strong>: is the ratio of enrolled children in the official school age group to the total number of children in the official school age group</li>
<li><strong>Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER)</strong>: is the ratio of&#xA0;enrolled children of all ages to the total number of children in the official school age group</li>
</ul><p>In countries where many children enter school later (or repeat grades) the GER can exceed 100%, whereas the NER cannot exceed 100%.</p></section>
