2018.</div><p>Literacy is a key skill and a key measure of a population&#x2019;s education. In this entry we discuss historical trends, as well as recent developments in literacy.</p><p>From a historical perspective, literacy levels for the world population have risen drastically in the last couple of centuries. While only 12% of the people in the world could read and write in 1820, today the share has reversed: only 17% of the world population remains illiterate. Over the last 65 years the global literacy rate increased by 4% every 5 years &#x2013; from 42% in 1960 to 86% in 2015.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Despite large improvements in the expansion of basic education, and the continuous reduction of education inequalities, there are substantial challenges ahead. The poorest countries in the world, where basic education is most likely to be a binding constraint for development, still have very large segments of the population who are illiterate. In Niger, for example, the literacy rate of the youth (15-24 years) is only 36.5%.</p></section>

It was only until the Middle Ages that book production started growing and literacy among the general population slowly started becoming important in the Western World.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> In fact, while the ambition of universal literacy in Europe was a fundamental reform born from the Enlightenment, it took centuries for it to happen. It was only in the 19th and 20th centuries that rates of literacy approached universality in early-industrialized countries.</p><p>The following visualization presents estimates of world literacy for the period 1800-2014. As we can see, literacy rates grew constantly but rather slowly until the beginning of the twentieth century. And the rate of growth really climbed after the middle of the 20th century, when the expansion of basic education became a global priority.

As it can be seen, the rising levels of education in Europe foreshadowed the emergence of modern societies.</p><p>Particularly fast improvements in literacy took place across Northwest Europe in the period 1600-1800.

Here we use historical estimates from England &#x2013; a country that was very much at the center of the development of modernity &#x2013; to show how the process towards universal literacy took place. Specifically, the following graph from Clark (2008)<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> shows how modernization &#x2013; characterized by science, technological progress, freedom and tolerance &#x2013; was enabled by improving the education of ever-larger shares of the population. It also shows how this process of expansion led to a reduction in education gender inequality.</p><p><a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/09/Literacy-in-the-UK-since-1580.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20574" src="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/09/Literacy-in-the-UK-since-1580-750x525.png" alt="Literacy in the uk since 1580" width="750" height="525" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Literacy-in-the-UK-since-1580-150x105.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Literacy-in-the-UK-since-1580-400x280.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Literacy-in-the-UK-since-1580-750x525.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Literacy-in-the-UK-since-1580-768x538.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Literacy-in-the-UK-since-1580.png 3000w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="in-the-us-the-expansion-of-literacy-helped-reduce-within-country-inequalities"><a class="deep-link" href="#in-the-us-the-expansion-of-literacy-helped-reduce-within-country-inequalities"></a>In the US, the expansion of literacy helped reduce within-country inequalities</h4><p>The expansion of literacy in early-industrialized countries helped reduce within-country inequalities. In the preceding visualization we showed that England virtually closed literacy gender gaps by 1900. Here we provide evidence of literacy gaps across races in the US.</p><p>The following visualization shows illiteracy rates by race for the period 1870-1979. As we can see, in order to reach near universal levels of literacy, the US had to close the race gap.

The following visualization shows literacy by age group for different country groups. The left panel corresponds to 1980, and the right panel to 1995.</p><p>We can see that all regions made substantial progress across the board &#x2013; so the series in 1995 are much more compressed towards the top than in 1980.</p><p>We can also see that younger generations are progressively better educated than older generations. And it is particularly promising that this intergenerational change is happening especially quickly in the least educated regions of our world: notice how the slopes of the lines in the least educated countries become progressively steeper.

(To explore changes across time use the slider underneath the map.)</p><p>The breakdown covers four categories: self-reported literacy declared directly by individuals, self-reported literacy declared by the head of the household, tested literacy from proficiency examinations, and indirect estimation or extrapolation.</p><p>In most cases, the categories covering &apos;self-reports&apos; (green and orange) correspond to estimates of literacy that rely on answers provided to a simple yes/no question asking people if they can read and write.</p><p>The category &apos;indirect estimation&apos; (black) corresponds mainly to estimates that rely on indirect evidence from educational attainment, usually based on the highest degree of completed education.</p><p>In <a href="https://owid.cloud/uploads/2018/03/Literacy-measurement-OWID-metadata.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this table</a> you find details regarding all literacy definitions and sources, country by country, and how we categorised them for the purpose of this chart.</p><p>This chart is telling us that:</p><ul>
<li>There is substantial cross-country variation, with recent estimates covering all four measurement methods.</li>
<li>There is variation within countries across time (e.g. Mexico switches between self-reports and extrapolation).</li>
<li>The number of countries that base their estimates on self-reports and testing is increasing.</li>
</ul><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/mode-of-reporting-literacy-rates" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/mode-of-reporting-literacy-rates" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/mode-of-reporting-literacy-rates_v19_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>Another way to dissect the same data, is to classify literacy estimates according to the type of measurement instrument used to collect the relevant data. In the next chart we explore this, splitting estimates into three categories: sampling, including data from literacy tests and household surveys; census data; and other instruments (e.g. administrative data on school enrollment).</p><p>Here we can see that most countries use sampling instruments (coded as &apos;surveys&apos; in the map), although in the past census data was more common. Literacy surveys have the potential of being more accurate &#x2013; when the sampling is done correctly &#x2013; because they allow for more specific and detailed measurement than short and generic questions in population censuses.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/literacy-rate-source-type" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/literacy-rate-source-type" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/literacy-rate-source-type_v29_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="data-quality-challenges-and-limitations"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-challenges-and-limitations"></a>Data quality: Challenges and limitations</h4><p>As mentioned above, recent data on literacy is often based on a single question included in national population censuses or household surveys presented to respondents above a certain age, where literacy skills are self-reported. The question is often phrased as &quot;can you read and write?&quot;. These self-reports of literacy skills have several limitations:</p><ul>
<li>Simple questions such as &quot;can you read and write?&quot; frame literacy as a skill you either possess or do not when, in reality, literacy is a multi-dimensional skill that exists on a continuum.</li>
<li>Self-reports are subjective, in that the question is dependent on what each individual understands by &quot;reading&quot; and &quot;writing&quot;. The form of a word may be familiar enough for a respondent to recall its sound or meaning without actually &#x2018;reading&#x2019; it. Similarly, when writing out one&#x2019;s name to convey written ability, this can be accomplished by &#x2018;drawing&#x2019; a familiar shape rather than writing in an effort to produce a written text with meaning.</li>
<li>In many cases surveys ask only one individual to report literacy on behalf of the entire household. This indirect reporting potentially introduces further noise, in particular when it comes to estimating literacy among women and children, since these groups are less often considered &apos;head of household&apos; in the surveys.</li>
</ul><p>Similarly, inferring literacy from data on educational attainment is also problematic, since schooling does not produce literacy in the same way everywhere: Proficiency tests show that in many low-income countries, a <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/students-in-grade-2-who-cant-read-a-single-word-ca-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large fraction</a> of second-grade primary-school students cannot read a single word of a short text; and for very few people in these countries going to school for four or five years <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/measuring-quality-girls-education-across-developing-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guarantees basic literacy</a>.</p><p>Even at a conceptual level there is lack of consensus &#x2013; national definitions of literacy that are based on educational attainment vary substantially from country to country. For example, in Greece people are considered literate if they have finished six years of primary education; while in Paraguay you qualify as literate if you have completed two years of primary school.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><h4 id="new-perspectives-through-standardized-literacy-tests"><a class="deep-link" href="#new-perspectives-through-standardized-literacy-tests"></a>New perspectives through standardized literacy tests</h4><p>Given the limitations of self-reported or indirectly inferred literacy estimates, efforts are being made at both national and international levels to conduct standardized literacy tests to assess proficiency in a systematic way.</p><p>In particular, large cross-country assessment surveys have been developed to overcome the challenges of producing comparable literacy data. Two important examples are the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which is a test used for measuring literacy mostly in rich countries; and the Literacy Assessment and Monitoring Programme (LAMP), which is a household assessment aimed at measuring literacy skills in developing countries, while remaining comparable across countries, languages, and scripts.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>The LAMP tests have only recently been field tested in four countries: Jordan, Mongolia, Palestine, and Paraguay. The PIAAC tests, on the other hand, have been administered in about 30 countries, and the results are shown in the chart below.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>We only have these tests for a few countries, but we can still see that there is an overall positive correlation. Moreover, we see that there is substantial variation in scores even for countries with identical and almost perfect literacy rates (e.g. Japan vs Italy). This confirms the fact that PIAAC tests capture a related, but broader concept of literacy.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/average-literacy-score-piaac-test-vs-national-literacy-rate-cia" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://owid.cloud/grapher/average-literacy-score-piaac-test-vs-national-literacy-rate-cia" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/average-literacy-score-piaac-test-vs-national-literacy-rate-cia_v12_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="reconstructing-estimates-from-the-past"><a class="deep-link" href="#reconstructing-estimates-from-the-past"></a>Reconstructing estimates from the past</h3><h4 id="census-data"><a class="deep-link" href="#census-data"></a>Census data</h4><p>The UNESCO definition of &quot;people who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life&quot;, started being recorded in census data from the end of the 19th century onwards.

(As we mention above, before 1990 almost all observations correspond to census data.)</p><p>As we can see, literacy rates tend to be much higher in countries where people tend to have more years of education; and as average years of education go up in a country, literacy rates also go up.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://owid.cloud/grapher/literacy-rates-vs-average-years-of-schooling" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://owid.cloud/grapher/literacy-rates-vs-average-years-of-schooling" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/literacy-rates-vs-average-years-of-schooling_v6_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>Countries with high literacy rates also tend to have higher results in the basic literacy tests included in the DHS surveys (this is a test that requires survey respondents to read a sentence showed to them). As we can see in the chart below, there is obviously noise, but these two variables are closely related.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/literacy-rate-adult-total-dhs-surveys-vs-unesco" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/literacy-rate-adult-total-dhs-surveys-vs-unesco" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/exports/literacy-rate-adult-total-dhs-surveys-vs-unesco_v11_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="other-historical-sources"><a class="deep-link" href="#other-historical-sources"></a>Other historical sources</h4><p>When census data is not available, a common method used to estimate literacy is to calculate the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/historical-literacy-in-england-by-sex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share of people who could sign official documents</a> (e.g. court documents, marriage certificates, etc).<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> As the researcher Jeremiah Dittmar <a href="http://www.jeremiahdittmar.com/files/Print-Welfare-Paper-5.27.2011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a>, this approach only gives a lower bound of the estimates because the number of people who could read was higher than the number who could write.</p><p>Indeed, other methods have been proposed, in order to rely on historical estimates of people who could read.

Each skills domain is divided into three performance levels; the top 30% of respondents at Level 3, the middle 40% of respondents correspondingly at Level 2, and the bottom 30% of respondents at Level 1.</p>
<p>The LAMP tests have only recently been field tested. The LAMP structure in these pilots (implemented in Jordan, Mongolia, Palestine, and Paraguay) is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Background questionnaire: collects information on the respondent’s educational attainment, self-reported literacy, literacy use in and outside of work, and occupation, amongst other information.</li>
<li>Filter test: Booklet with 17 items to determine if respondent takes Module A (for low performers) or Module B (for high performers)</li>
<li>Module A: Testing prose, document, and numeracy items.</li>
<li>Module B: Respondent is randomly assigned Booklet 1 or Booklet 2, both testing prose, document, and numeracy skills for high performers of the filter test.</li>
