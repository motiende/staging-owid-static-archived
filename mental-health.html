We address substance use disorders (alcohol and drug use disorders) in separate entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/substance-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Use</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alcohol Consumption</a>.</p><p>Most of the estimates presented in this entry are produced by the <em>Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</em> and reported in their flagship <em>Global Burden of Disease</em> study.</p><p>Mental health and substance use disorders are still significantly under-reported. This is true across all countries, but particularly at lower incomes where data is scarcer, and there is less attention and treatment for mental health disorders.</p><p>Mental health disorders are complex and can take many forms. The underlying sources of the data presented in this entry apply specific definitions (which we describe in each relevant section), typically in accordance with&#xA0;WHO&apos;s <em>International Classification of Diseases</em> (ICD-10). This broad definition incorporates many forms, including depression, anxiety, bipolar, eating disorders and schizophrenia.</p><p>Mental health disorders remain widely under-reported&#xA0;&#x2014; in our section on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#data-availability-on-mental-health">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a> we discuss the challenges of dealing with this data. Figures presented in this entry should be taken as <strong>estimates</strong> of mental health disorder prevalence&#xA0;&#x2014; they do not strictly reflect diagnosis data (which would provide the global perspective on diagnosis, rather than actual prevalence differences), but are imputed from a combination of medical, epidemiological data, surveys and meta-regression modelling where raw data is unavailable. Further information can be found <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#how-is-prevalence-defined-and-measured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>In many cases, we may therefore consider reported estimates to be an under-estimation of true prevalence and disease burden. It is also important to keep in mind that the uncertainty of the data on mental health is generally high so we should be cautious about interpreting changes over time and differences between countries. Even taking into account that mental health disorders are likely underreported, the data presented in this entry demonstrate that mental health disorders are common and have a high prevalence. Improving awareness, recognition, support and treatment for this range of disorders should therefore be an essential focus for global health.</p><p>The table below provides a brief summary of the data which follows on mental health and substance use disorders.

However, it is useful as introduction to understand the total prevalence and disease burden which results from the broad IHME and WHO category of &apos;mental health and substance use disorders&apos;.&#xA0;This category comprises a range of disorders including depression, anxiety, bipolar, eating disorders, schizophrenia, intellectual developmental disability, and alcohol and drug use disorders.</p><p>In the chart below we see that globally, mental and substance use disorders are very common: around 1-in-6 people (15-20 percent) have one or more mental or substance use disorders.</p><p>It&apos;s estimated that <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-with-mental-and-substance-use-disorders">over 1.1 billion</a>&#xA0;people worldwide had a mental or substance use disorder in 2016.&#xA0;The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-with-mental-and-neurodevelopmental-disorders-by-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest number of people</a> had an anxiety disorder, estimated at around 4 percent of the population.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-mental-and-substance-disorders" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-mental-and-substance-disorders" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-with-mental-and-substance-disorders_v4_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>The scatterplot below compares the prevalence of these disorders between males and females. Taken together we see that in most countries this group of disorders is more common for men than for women. However, as is shown later in this entry and in our entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/substance-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Use</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alcohol</a>, this varies significantly by disorder type: on average, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder is more prevalent in women. Gender differences in schizophrenia prevalence are mixed across countries, but it is typically more common in men. Alcohol and drug use disorders are more common in men.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-mental-or-substance-disorders-males-vs-females" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-with-mental-or-substance-disorders-males-vs-females" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-with-mental-or-substance-disorders-males-vs-females_v5_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="deaths-from-mental-health-and-substance-use-disorders"><a class="deep-link" href="#deaths-from-mental-health-and-substance-use-disorders"></a>Deaths from mental health and substance use disorders</h3><p>The direct death toll from mental health and substance use disorders is typically low. In this entry, the only direct death estimates result from eating disorders, which occur through malnutrition and related health complications. Direct deaths can also result from alcohol and substance use disorders; these are covered in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/substance-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Use</a>.</p><p>However, mental health disorders are also attributed to significant number of indirect deaths through suicide and self-harm. Suicide deaths are strongly linked&#xA0;&#x2014; although not always attributed to&#xA0;&#x2014; mental health disorders. We discuss the evidence of this link between mental health and suicide in detail&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health/#link-between-mental-health-and-suicide">later in this entry</a>.</p><p>In high-income countries, meta-analyses suggest that up to 90 percent of suicide deaths result from underlying mental and substance use disorders. However, in middle to lower-income countries there is evidence that this figure is notably lower.&#xA0;A study by Ferrari et al. (2015) attempted to determine the share disease burden from suicide which could be attributed to mental health or substance use disorders.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Based on review across a number of meta-analysis studies the authors estimated that only 68 percent of suicides across China, Taiwan and India were attributed to mental health and substance use disorders. Here, studies suggest a large number of suicides result from the &#x2018;dysphoric affect&#x2019; and &#x2018;impulsivity&#x2019; (which are not defined as a mental and substance use disorder). It is important to understand the differing nature of self-harm methods between countries; in these countries a high percentage of self-harming behaviours are carried out through more lethal methods such as poisoning (often through pesticides) and self-immolation. This means many self-harming behaviours can prove fatal, even if there was no clear intent to die.</p><p>As a result, direct attribution of suicide deaths to mental health disorders is difficult. Nonetheless, it&apos;s estimated that a large share of suicide deaths link back to mental health. Studies suggest that for an individual with depression the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#mental-health-as-a-risk-factor-for-suicide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risk of suicide</a> is around 20 times higher than an individual without.</p><h3 id="disease-burden-of-mental-health-and-substance-use-disorders"><a class="deep-link" href="#disease-burden-of-mental-health-and-substance-use-disorders"></a>Disease burden of mental health and substance use disorders</h3><p>Health impacts are often measured in terms of total numbers of deaths, but a focus on mortality means that the burden of mental health disorders can be underestimated<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><p>Measuring the health impact by mortality alone fails to capture the impact that mental health disorders have on an individual&apos;s wellbeing. The &apos;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease">disease burden</a>&apos; &#x2013; measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) &#x2013; considers not only the mortality associated with a disorder, but also years lived with disability or health burden. The map below shows DALYs as a share of total disease burden; mental and substance use disorders account for around 7 percent of global disease burden in 2016, but this reaches up to 13-14 percent in several countries. These disorders have the highest contribution to overall health burden in Australia and United States.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="depression"><a class="deep-link" href="#depression"></a>Depression</h3><h4 id="definition-of-depression"><a class="deep-link" href="#definition-of-depression"></a>Definition of depression</h4><p>Depressive disorders occur with varying severity. The WHO&apos;s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) <a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">define this set of disorders</a> ranging from mild to moderate to severe. The IHME adopt such definitions by disaggregating to mild, persistent depression (dysthymia) and major depressive disorder (severe).</p><p>All forms of depressive disorder experience some of the following symptoms:</p><ul>
<li>(a) reduced concentration and attention;</li>
<li>(b) reduced self-esteem and self-confidence;</li>
<li>(c) ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode);</li>
<li>(d) bleak and pessimistic views of the future;</li>
<li>(e) ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide;</li>
<li>(f) disturbed sleep</li>
<li>(g) diminished appetite.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Mild persistent depression (dysthymia)</strong> tends to have the following diagnostic guidelines:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatiguability are usually regarded as the most typical symptoms of depression, and at least two of these, plus at least two of the other symptoms described on page 119 (for F32.-) should usually be present for a definite diagnosis. None of the symptoms should be present to an intense degree. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a mild depressive episode is usually distressed by the symptoms and has some difficulty in continuing with ordinary work and social activities, but will probably not cease to function completely.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Severe depressive disorder</strong> tends to have the following diagnostic guidelines:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In a severe depressive episode, the sufferer usually shows considerable distress or agitation, unless retardation is a marked feature. Loss of self-esteem or feelings of uselessness or guilt are likely to be prominent, and suicide is a distinct danger in particularly severe cases. It is presumed here that the somatic syndrome will almost always be present in a severe depressive episode. During a severe depressive episode it is very unlikely that the sufferer will be able to continue with social, work, or domestic activities, except to a very limited extent.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The series of charts below present the latest global estimates of the prevalence and disease burden of depressive disorders. Depressive disorders, as <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#depressions">defined by the underlying source</a>, cover a spectrum of severity ranging from mild persistent depression (dysthymia) to major (severe) depressive disorder.

This therefore incorporates a spectrum of disordered eating behaviours. The underlying sources presented here present data only for the disorders of anorexia and bulimia nervosa (as defined below). It is however recognised that a large share of eating disorders fall outwith the definition of either anorexia or bulimia nervosa (these are often termed &apos;eating disorders not otherwise specified&apos;; EDNOS)&#xA0;&#x2014; some estimates report at least 60 percent of eating disorders do not meet the standard criteria.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p>It is therefore expected that the data presented below significantly underestimates the true prevalence of eating disorders, since it concerns only clinically-diagnosed anorexia and bulimia nervosa.</p><p><strong>Anorexia nervosa</strong></p><p>&quot;Anorexia nervosa is a disorder exemplified by deliberate weight loss, and associated with undernutrition of varying severity.</p><p>For a definite diagnosis, the ICD note that all the following are required:</p><p>(a) Body weight is maintained at least 15% below that expected (either lost or never achieved), or Quetelet&apos;s body-mass index4 is 17.5 or less. 4 Quetelet&apos;s body-mass index = weight (kg) to be used for age 16 or more - 139 - Prepubertal patients may show failure to make the expected weight gain during the period of growth;</p><p>(b) The weight loss is self-induced by avoidance of &quot;fattening foods&quot;. One or more of the following may also be present: self-induced vomiting; self-induced purging; excessive exercise; use of appetite suppressants and/or diuretics;</p><p>(c) There is body-image distortion in the form of a specific psychopathology whereby a dread of fatness persists as an intrusive, overvalued idea and the patient imposes a low weight threshold on himself or herself;</p><p>(d) A widespread endocrine disorder involving the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal axis is manifest in women as amenorrhoea and in men as a loss of sexual interest and potency. (An apparent exception is the persistence of vaginal bleeds in anorexic women who are receiving replacement hormonal therapy, most commonly taken as a contraceptive pill.) There may also be elevated levels of growth hormone, raised levels of cortisol, changes in the peripheral metabolism of the thyroid hormone, and abnormalities of insulin secretion;</p><p>(e) If onset is prepubertal, the sequence of pubertal events is delayed or even arrested (growth ceases; in girls the breasts do not develop and there is a primary amenorrhoea; in boys the genitals remain juvenile). With recovery, puberty is often completed normally, but the menarche is late.&quot;</p><p><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong></p><p>&quot;Bulimia nervosa is an illness defined by repeated behaviours of overeating, preoccupation with control of body weight, and the adoption of extreme measures to mitigate the impacts of overeating.</p><p>For a definite diagnosis, the ICD note that all the following are required:</p><p>(a) There is a persistent preoccupation with eating, and an irresistible craving for food; the patient succumbs to episodes of overeating in which large amounts of food are consumed in short periods of time.</p><p>(b) The patient attempts to counteract the &quot;fattening&quot; effects of food by one or more of the following: self-induced vomiting; purgative abuse, alternating periods of starvation; use of drugs such as appetite suppressants, thyroid preparations or diuretics. When bulimia occurs in diabetic patients they may choose to neglect their insulin treatment.</p><p>(c) The psychopathology consists of a morbid dread of fatness and the patient sets herself or himself a sharply defined weight threshold, well below the premorbid weight that constitutes the optimum or healthy weight in the opinion of the physician. There is often, but not always, a history of an earlier episode of anorexia nervosa, the interval between the two disorders ranging from a few months to several years. This earlier episode may have been fully expressed, or may have assumed a minor cryptic form with a moderate loss of weight and/or a transient phase of amenorrhoea.&quot;</p><h4 id="prevalence-of-eating-disorders"><a class="deep-link" href="#prevalence-of-eating-disorders"></a>Prevalence of eating disorders</h4><p>The prevalence of eating disorders (anorexia and bulimia nervosa) ranges from 0.05 to 0.55 percent by country.&#xA0;Globally an <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-with-eating-disorder-country" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated 10.5 million</a> had clinical anorexia and bulimia nervosa in 2016.

Identifying potential risk factors form an important element of health research, potential prevention and in some cases, appropriate treatment; nonetheless, many risk factors remain only correlates of observed patterns in mental health. They therefore need to be interpreted carefully.</p><p>The World Health Organization synthesize the potential contributors to mental health and wellbeing into three categories:<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><ul>
<li>individual attributes and behaviours: these can be particular genetic factors or personality traits;</li>
<li>social and economic circumstances;</li>
<li>environmental factors.</li>
</ul><p>In the table below we see the WHO&apos;s breakdown of potential adverse and protective factors for mental health within these three categories. These factors often interact, compound or negate one another and should therefore not be considered as individual traits or exposures. For example, particular individual traits may make a given person more vulnerable to mental health disorders with the onset of a particular economic or social scenario&#xA0;&#x2014; the instance of one does not necessarily result in a mental health disorder, but combined there is a significantly higher vulnerability.</p><p><div class="tableContainer"><table class="tablepress"><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Adverse Factors</th><th>Protective Factors</th></tr></thead><tbody class="row-hover"><tr><td><strong>Individual attributes</strong></td><td>Low self-esteem</td><td>Self-esteem, confidence</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cognitive/emotional immaturity</td><td>Ability to solve problems &amp; manage stress or adversity</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Difficulties in communicating</td><td>Communication skills</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Medical illness, substance use</td><td>Physical health, fitness</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social circumstances</strong></td><td>Loneliness, bereavement</td><td>Social support of family &amp; friends</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Neglect, family conflict</td><td>Good parenting/family interaction</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Exposure to violence/abuse</td><td>Physical security &amp; safety</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Low income &amp; poverty</td><td>Economic security</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Difficulties or failure at school</td><td>Scholastic achievement</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Work stress, unemployment</td><td>Satisfaction &amp; success at work</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Environmental factors</strong></td><td>Poor access to basic services</td><td>Equality of access to basic services</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Injustice &amp; discrimination</td><td>Social justice, tolerance, integration</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Social &amp; gender inequalities</td><td>Social &amp; gender equality</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Exposure to war or disaster</td><td>Physical security &amp; safety</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p><h4 id="risk-factors-through-the-life-course"><a class="deep-link" href="#risk-factors-through-the-life-course"></a>Risk factors through the life-course</h4><p>The risk factors and influencers on mental health vary significantly for an individual as they move through the life-course. The following are acknowledged risk factors for a given stage of life.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p><strong>&#x2013; Pre-conception and pre-natal period</strong></p><p>A given individual&apos;s mental health and wellbeing can be influenced by factors present prior to conception or birth. Pregnancies which are unwanted or in adolescence can increase the likelihood of detrimental behaviours of the mother during pregnancy, and the environmental or family conditions of childhood.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> During pregnancy, detrimental behaviours including tobacco, alcohol and drug use can increase the likelihood of later mental health disorders for children; malnutrition, low-birth weight and micronutrient deficiency (for example, iodine deficiency) can also influence later mental health vulnerabilities.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p><strong>&#x2013; Infancy and early childhood</strong></p><p>There is a large base of evidence which shows that emotional attachment in early childhood has a considerable impact on later vulnerability to mental health and wellbeing.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> As a result, particular risk factors include separation from the primary caregiver, in some cases post-natal depression in mothers (which can result in sub-optimal attachment), and parents for whom communication and social interaction is challenging. Child maltreatment and neglect has been found to have a significant impact on vulnerabilities to mental wellbeing.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> Malnutrition, poor access to basic services and disease and parasites are also important contributors.</p><p><strong>&#x2013; Childhood</strong></p><p>Childhood conditions form a critical component of health and wellbeing later in life. Negative experiences, either at home or outside of the home (for example, bullying in school) can have lifelong impacts on the development of core cognitive and emotional skills. Poor socioeconomic conditions also have a significant effect on vulnerability to mental health disorders; in a study in Sweden, the authors found that children raised in families of poor socioeconomic backgrounds had an increased risk of psychosis.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> Poor economic resources, shown through poor housing conditions for example, can be seen by children as shameful or degrading and affect aspects of childhood learning, communication and interaction with peers.</p><p>Children with a parent who has a mental illness or substance use disorder have a higher risk of psychiatric problems themselves.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> This effect between generations can occur as a result of genetic, biological, psychological and social risk factors.</p><p><strong>&#x2013; Adolescence</strong></p><p>Adolescence is typically the stage of life where mental health disorders tend to become more apparent. The risk factors and contributors to wellbeing in childhood apply equally to those in adolescence. In addition, several other contributing factors appear. It is in the years of adolescence that the use of substances including alcohol and drugs first appear.</p><p>Substance use is particularly hazardous and harmful for adolescents because individuals are still developing both mentally and physically. Peer pressure, and media influences also become more prominent over these years. Exposure to substance use is not only an important risk factor for other mental health disorders, but also linked to poorer educational outcomes, more risky sexual behaviour and increased exposure to violence and conflict.</p><p><strong>&#x2013; Adulthood</strong></p><p>Experiences and emotional capabilities developed through childhood and adolescence are important factors in the effect that particular events and scenarios in adulthood have on mental health outcomes.</p><p>The WHO highlight that critical to wellbeing in adulthood is the allocation and balance between work and leisure time. Exposure to high stress and anxiety is strongly influenced by the share of time working, caring for others, or time spent in an insecure economic environment. Individuals with poor socioeconomic security, and in particular unemployment, are also at higher risk to mental health disorders.</p><p>These factors, balanced with the amount of time spent on &apos;consumption&apos; activities, including leisure time and supportive family and friends, often determine the propensity for poor mental health and wellbeing. Community structures can have a significant positive impact on these outcomes&#xA0;&#x2014; individuals who have poor access to such communities, either through social exclusion, neighbourhood violence/crime, or lack of respite care have a higher risk of mental health disorders.</p><p>Physical health also has an important impact on mental wellbeing; an individual&apos;s &apos;physical capital&apos; can influence their sense of esteem and social inclusion. Individuals with chronic illness or disability are at higher risk of poor mental health; this is particularly true for conditions with high rates of stigmatisation, such as HIV/AIDS.</p><p><strong>&#x2013; Older age</strong></p><p>Individuals of older age are of notably high risk of poorer mental health and wellbeing. This typically results from notable changes in life conditions (such as a cease in employment which affects both the feeling of contribution and economic freedom), higher social exclusion, and loneliness. This is particularly true when an older individual begins to lose close family and friends. Bereavement in general is an important predictor of mental health disorders such as depression.</p><p>A decline in physical health can have major impacts on life capabilities by affecting an individual&apos;s mobility and freedom. Older individuals are also at higher risk of abuse or neglect from carers and in some cases, family members.</p><h3 id="link-between-mental-health-and-suicide"><a class="deep-link" href="#link-between-mental-health-and-suicide"></a>Link between mental health and suicide</h3><p>The link between mental health and substance use disorders and suicide is well-documented.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a> It is however true that not all suicides - or suicide attempts - are attributed to underlying mental health or substance use disorders; as shown in the chart below, there is not a direct relationship between mental health prevalence and suicide rates.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></p><p>We cover suicide statistics more broadly in our full entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/suicide">Suicide</a>, however here we attempt to distil the key findings on the links between mental health and substance use and suicide. Although mental health and substance use disorders is within the top-five <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-total-disease-burden-by-cause" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causes of disease burden</a> globally (as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years; DALYs), accounting for approximately 7 percent of the burden, several authors have highlighted that such figures &#x2014; since they do not include suicide DALYs &#x2014; underestimate the true cost of mental health disorders.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a> Providing a more accurate estimate of total mental health burden therefore requires some understanding of the connection between these disorders and suicide.</p><p>Meta-analyses of psychological autopsy studies of suicide&#xA0;across high-income countries suggest that up to 90 percent of suicides occur as a result of an underlying mental health or substance use disorder.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a> While available data and studies are more scarce across lower-to-middle income countries, evidence across countries including China, Taiwan and India suggest that this proportion is significantly lower elsewhere.<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a> These studies suggest a large number of suicides resultant from the &#x2018;dysphoric affect&#x2019; and &#x2018;impulsivity&#x2019; (which are not defined as a mental and substance use disorder). In such cases, understanding the nature of self-harm methods between countries is important; in these countries a high percentage of self-harming behaviours are carried out through more lethal methods such as poisoning (often through pesticides) and self-immolation. This means that in a high number of cases self-harming behaviours can prove fatal, even if there was not a clear intent to die.</p><p>A study by Ferrari et al. (2015) attempted to determine the share disease burden from suicide which could be attributed to mental health or substance use disorders.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a> Based on review across a number of meta-analysis studies the authors estimated that 68 percent of suicides across China, Taiwan and India were attributed to mental health and substance use disorders; across other countries this share was approximately 85 percent. In their estimates of total attributable disease burden, the authors concluded that mental health and substance use disorders were responsible for 62 percent of total DALYs from suicide.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/suicide-rates-vs-prevalence-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/suicide-rates-vs-prevalence-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/suicide-rates-vs-prevalence-of-mental-and-substance-use-disorders_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="mental-health-as-a-risk-factor-for-suicide"><a class="deep-link" href="#mental-health-as-a-risk-factor-for-suicide"></a>Mental health as a risk factor for suicide</h4><p>Although the total prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders does not show a direct relationship to suicide rates (as shown in the chart above), there are notable links between specific types of mental health disorders and suicide.

The increased risk of a substance use disorder varies by mental health disorder type:</p><ul>
<li>for alcohol dependency the risk is highest in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder, dysthymia, ODD, bipolar disorder and social phobia. This is discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-consumption#mental-health-disorders-as-a-risk-factor-for-alcohol-dependency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alcohol Consumption</a>.</li>
<li>for illicit drug dependency the risk is highest for individuals with intermittent explosive disorder, ADHD, and bipolar disorder.&#xA0;This is discussed in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/substance-use#mental-health-disorders-as-a-risk-factor-for-substance-dependency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Use</a>.</li>

There is not a single &apos;best approach&apos; to treatment.</p><p>One option for treatment of depression is the prescription of antidepressant drugs. But are antidepressant drugs effective in reducing the severity of depression? In the chart below we present the results of the latest and largest meta-analysis on antidepressant drug efficacy to date, as published by Cipriani et al. (2018) in&#xA0;<em>The Lancet</em>.<a id="ref-31" class="ref" href="#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a></p><p>This meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of 21 antidepressant drugs relative to a placebo across 522 trials comprising 116,477 participants. Effectiveness, given as the response rate, was measured by&#xA0;the total number of patients who had a reduction of &#x2265;50% of the total score on a standardised observer-rating scale for depression. The odds-ratio measures the likelihood of a positive response from the antidepressant relative to the placebo (where a value of 2.0 indicates the antidepressant was twice as likely as the placebo).</p><p>As shown, all 21 antidepressant drugs were more effective than the placebo in reducing the severity of depression in adults. They did, however, vary in effectiveness. However, this meta-analysis also reported variance in levels of &apos;acceptability&apos;, which measures the&#xA0;the proportion of patients who withdrew for any reason (such as side-effects from the antidepressant drug). The use and choice of antidepressants will therefore be specific to the individual dependent on a range of factors and their response to treatment.</p><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Are-antidepressants-effective-01-2.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-19101" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Are-antidepressants-effective-01-2.png" alt="" width="803" height="777"></a></p></section>






















































<section><h2 id="data-quality-definitions-and-measurement"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definitions-and-measurement"></a>Data Quality, Definitions and Measurement</h2><h3 id="how-is-prevalence-defined-and-measured"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-is-prevalence-defined-and-measured"></a>How is prevalence defined and measured?</h3><p>The widespread issue of underreporting means accurate and representative data on the prevalence of disorders is difficult to define. If relying on mental health diagnoses alone, this underestimation would be severe. Prevalence figures would be likely to reflect healthcare spending (which allows for more focus on mental health disorders) rather than giving a representative perspective on differences between countries; high-income countries would likely show significantly higher prevalence as a result of more diagnoses.</p><p>The data presented in this entry by the Institute of Health Metrics &amp; Evaluation (IHME) is therefore based on a combination of sources, including medical and national records, epidemiological data, in addition to survey data. Where raw data for a particular country is scarce, epidemiological data and meta-regression models must be used based on available data from neighbouring countries. Data quality issues are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health">described below</a>.</p><p>The data presented here therefore offers an&#xA0;<em>estimate</em> (rather than official diagnosis) of mental health prevalence based on medical, epidemiological data, surveys and meta-regression modelling.</p><h3 id="data-availability-on-mental-health"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-availability-on-mental-health"></a>Data availability on mental health</h3><p>The majority of data presented in this entry is based on estimates from the IHME&apos;s <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool">Global Burden of Disease</a> (GBD). This is currently one of the only sources which produces global level estimates across most countries on the prevalence and disease burden of mental health and substance use disorders.</p><p>Nonetheless, the GBD acknowledges the clear data gaps which exist on mental health prevalence across the world. Despite being the 5th largest disease burden at a global level (and with within the top three across many countries), detailed data is often lacking. This is particularly true of lower-income countries. The Global Burden of Disease note that the range of epidemiological studies they draw upon for global and national estimates are unequally distributed across disorders, age groups, countries and epidemiological parameters.<a id="ref-32" class="ref" href="#note-32"><sup>32</sup></a> Using these studies to provide full coverage of these disorders is challenging.</p><p>To overcome these methodological challenges the authors note:</p><blockquote><p>To deal with this issue and be able to include data derived using various study methodologies and designs, GBD 2013 makes use of DisMod-MR, version 2.0, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. The software makes it possible to pool all of the epidemiological data available for a given disorder into a weighted average, while simultaneously adjusting for known sources of variability in estimates reported across studies. If raw data are not available for a given country, the software produces an imputed estimate for each epidemiological parameter based on data available from surrounding countries. This allowed GBD to include estimates for 188 countries.</p></blockquote><h3 id="comparison-of-ihme-estimates-to-other-sources"><a class="deep-link" href="#comparison-of-ihme-estimates-to-other-sources"></a>Comparison of IHME estimates to other sources</h3><p>In this entry we have focused on data trends published by the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME) Global Burden of Disease study. This is currently the only source which provides estimates for all countries over time, and across the full range of mental health and substance use disorders. The World Health Organization (WHO) publish estimates on depression only; the comparison of depression prevalence from IHME versus WHO is shown in the scatter plot below.</p><p>A range of national sources also publish estimated prevalence of depression. In many cases, the &apos;boundaries&apos;, or category differentiation in mental health disorders is different from IHME estimates. They are often therefore not directly comparable. For example, the Center for Diseases Control (CDC) in the United States <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/diseases/depression-anxiety.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides information</a> and estimates on combined depression and anxiety disorders, treating anxiety as a&#xA0;<em>subset</em> of depression.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/depression-ihme-vs-who" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/depression-ihme-vs-who" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/depression-ihme-vs-who_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>
