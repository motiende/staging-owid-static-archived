There are always qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interaction. These take the form of an inadequate appreciation of socio-emotional cues, as shown by a lack of responses to other people&apos;s emotions and/or a lack of modulation of behaviour according to social context; poor use of social signals and a weak integration of social, emotional, and communicative behaviours; and, especially, a lack of socio-emotional reciprocity.</p><p>&quot;The condition is also characterized by restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. These take the form of a tendency to impose rigidity and routine on a wide range of aspects of day-to day functioning; this usually applies to novel activities as well as to familiar habits and play patterns.&quot;</p><p><strong>Atypical autism</strong></p><p>&apos;Atypical autism&apos; differs from childhood autism either based on the age of onset, or the number of diagnostic criteria which are fulfilled. Those with atypical autism develop the condition after the age of 3 and/or they do not demonstrate behaviours in one or two of the three areas which typically diagnose autism (i.e. reciprocal social interactions, communication, and restrictive, stereotyped, repetitive behaviour).</p><h4 id="prevalence-of-autism"><a class="deep-link" href="#prevalence-of-autism"></a>Prevalence of autism</h4><p>The prevalence of autism typically ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 percent across countries.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-population-with-autism" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-population-with-autism" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-of-the-population-with-autism_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>Like the full spectrum of autistic spectrum disorders, males are much more likely to have autism than females.

The ICD provide the following definition and diagnostic criteria for Asperger Syndrome:</p><p>&quot;A disorder of uncertain nosological validity, characterized by the same kind of qualitative abnormalities of reciprocal social interaction that typify autism, together with a restricted, stereotyped, repetitive repertoire of interests and activities. The disorder differs from autism primarily in that there is no general delay or retardation in language or in cognitive development.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Diagnosis is based on the combination of a lack of any clinically significant general delay in language or cognitive development plus, as with autism, the presence of qualitative deficiencies in reciprocal social interaction and restricted, repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. There may or may not be problems in communication similar to those associated with autism, but significant language retardation would rule out the diagnosis.&quot;</p><h4 id="prevalence-of-asperger-syndrome-and-other-autistic-spectrum-disorders"><a class="deep-link" href="#prevalence-of-asperger-syndrome-and-other-autistic-spectrum-disorders"></a>Prevalence of Asperger Syndrome and other autistic spectrum disorders</h4><p>The prevalence of Asperger Syndrome and other autistic spectrum disorders (not including autism) typically ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 percent across countries.

Their chief characteristics are lack of persistence in activities that require cognitive involvement, and a tendency to move from one activity to another without completing any one, together with disorganized, ill-regulated, and excessive activity. These problems usually persist through school years and even into adult life, but many affected individuals show a gradual improvement in activity and attention.&quot;</p><h4 id="prevalence-of-adhd"><a class="deep-link" href="#prevalence-of-adhd"></a>Prevalence of ADHD</h4><p>The prevalence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ranges from 0.5 to 2 percent of the population across countries.</p><p>Males are typically 2 to 3 times more likely to have ADHD versus females.
