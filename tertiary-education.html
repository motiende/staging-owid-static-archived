During this early period, centers of education mostly had a religious focus and trained clergy. In Western Europe these centers were monasteries, while in the Islamic world these were madrasas. The following table shows the increasing number of monasteries in Western Europe&#xA0;between the 6th and the 15th century.</p><h4 id="the-secularization-of-higher-education-in-europe"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-secularization-of-higher-education-in-europe"></a>The Secularization of Higher Education in Europe</h4><p>The number of all monasteries in Western Europe is displayed below. Between the end of the first millennium and the 13th century the number grew&#xA0;rapidly, before coming to a halt and declining.</p><p>At the same time evolved&#xA0;a new form of a higher education&#xA0;institution: the university. These secular institutions began to rise as monasteries slowly started to decline, and the religious powers lost their monopoly on higher education. Still, this was only the beginning; as late as the 18th century there were still fewer&#xA0;than 100 universities in Western Europe.</p><p>The raw data on monasteries and universities in Europe over the long-run published by Buringh and Van Zanden is available on a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/monasteries-and-universities-in-europe-over-the-long-run/">separate page</a>.</p><h6>Total number of monasteries and total number of universities in Western Europe, 600-1800<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></h6><p><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-11-at-12.41.13-pm.png" alt="" width="1672" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15765"></p><h3 id="higher-education-today-and-into-the-future"><a class="deep-link" href="#higher-education-today-and-into-the-future"></a>Higher Education Today and into the Future</h3><p>The following visualisations show estimations and projections from 1970 to 2050 of higher education by country.
