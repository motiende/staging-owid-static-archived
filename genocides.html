The Holocaust is perhaps the darkest chapter in human history. The scale, organisation and nature of the killing was unprecedented and there has been a concerted effort ever since to prevent a similar tragedy. The first session of the United Nations General Assembly affirmed the crime of genocide describing it as &quot;a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, as homicide is the denial of the right to live of individual human beings.&quot; <a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><h6>Rate of deaths in genocides, 1900-2008 &#x2013; Pinker (2011)<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

<p>The following chart tracks at the number of active genocides and politicides around the world between 1955-2014. The data comes from the Political Instability Task Force and details of the definition used in their construction can be found in the <a href="#definition-of-genocide-and-politicide-pitf">definitions section</a>.</p>

<p>The map below displays the death magnitude as recorded by the PITF. The death magnitude is a non-linear scale developed by the PITF to classify the number of people killed in each episode. For countries that experienced multiple episodes of genocide, a new value is calculated using the midpoint of the range.

</h6><h3 id="historical-genocides"><a class="deep-link" href="#historical-genocides"></a>Historical Genocides</h3><p>Although the word genocide was only created in the 20th century, there exist many historical examples of genocide. One of the earliest examples identified is the destruction of Melos in 416 BCE by the Athenian army. The Athenians laid siege to the small island of Melos until the Melian government surrendered, at which point the Athenians proceeded to kill all the adult men and enslaved the women and children. A useful reference for genocide in the ancient world can be found <a href="http://www.ancient.eu/article/485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p></section>




<section><h2 id="correlates-determinants-consequences"><a class="deep-link" href="#correlates-determinants-consequences"></a>Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2><h3 id="causes-mainstream-theories"><a class="deep-link" href="#causes-mainstream-theories"></a>Causes: Mainstream Theories</h3><p>The mainstream theories of the causes of can be broadly summarised as:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Fractionalisation, grievance and dehumanisation</strong>: This group of theories collectively argue that genocide can be predicted by higher ethnolinguistic or religious fractionalisation within a country combined with grievances between groups. The final important dimension is dehumanisation of the victim group. This theory is associated with the sociologist Leo Kuper, who conducted some of the earliest studies in comparative genocide.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>National crises</strong>: Here, catastrophic events such as war, economic depression or revolution are the triggers for genocide or other types of mass killing. This causality is motivated by one of two theories, the scapegoat thoery and the political opportunity thoery. The first theory posits that a particular group is identified as the cause of the crisis and that the solution is to eliminate the group. The second theory instead argues that the crisis creates the opporunity for a group to consolidate their power.</li>
<li><strong>Government power</strong>: This theory is largely due to Rudolph Rummel and is referred to as the power principle. Rummel argues that &quot;The more power a government has, the more it can act arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the elite, and the more it will make war on others and murder its foreign and domestic subjects. The more constrained the power of governments, the less it will aggress on others.&quot;<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> A major implication of this theory is that authoritarian regimes are far more likely to resort to democide than democratic regimes.</li>

<section><h2 id="data-quality-definitions"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definitions"></a>Data Quality &amp; Definitions</h2><h3 id="data-quality"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality"></a>Data Quality</h3><p>One major obstacle in quantifying atrocities of this nature is that many perpetrators work hard to conceal the true number of victims or simply do not keep count. For this reason the estimated death tolls are imprecise with large confidence intervals. Scholars still debate the number of victims of The Holocaust, the largest and most well documented case of genocide in human history.</p><h3 id="definition-of-genocide-united-nations"><a class="deep-link" href="#definition-of-genocide-united-nations"></a>Definition of Genocide: United Nations</h3><p>The United Nations uses the following definition to classify acts of genocide:<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><blockquote><p>any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</p></blockquote><h3 id="definitions-rudolph-rummel"><a class="deep-link" href="#definitions-rudolph-rummel"></a>Definitions: Rudolph Rummel</h3><p>Rudolph Rummel was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii and wrote many seminal works on war and violence. Rummel was the first to distinguish between different forms of state violence and invented the term democide. His definitions are listed below:<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><ol>
<li><strong>Genocide</strong>: among other things, the killing of people by a government because of their indelible group membership (race, ethnicity, religion, language).</li>
<li><strong>Politicide</strong>: the murder of any person or people by a government because of their politics or for political purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Mass Murder</strong>: the indiscriminate killing of any person or people by a government.</li>
<li><strong>Democide</strong>: The murder of any person or people by a government, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder.</li>
</ol><p>It is important to recognise that these definitions are not the same as those used by the Political Instability Task Force (PITF). In the PITF dataset a dominant entity other than the government may carry out politicide and a distinction is made between state terror and politicide.</p><h3 id="definition-of-genocide-and-politicide-pitf"><a class="deep-link" href="#definition-of-genocide-and-politicide-pitf"></a>Definition of Genocide and Politicide: PITF</h3><p>The dataset used for data visualisations in this section is the Political Instability Task Force (PITF). A distinction is made between acts of genocide and politicide, the first being motivated by ethnic or religious difference, while the second is motivated by political opposition to the dominant power. Another important distinction is made between genocide/politicide and state repression or terror.</p><blockquote><p>In genocides the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal (ethnolinguistic, religious) characteristics. In politicides, by contrast, groups are defined primarily in terms of their political opposition to the regime and dominant groups.</p>
<p>Genocide and politicide are distinguished from state repression and terror. In cases of state terror authorities arrest, persecute or execute a few members of a group in ways designed to terrorize the majority of the group into passivity or acquiescence. In the case of genocide and politicide authorities physically exterminate enough (not necessarily all) members of a target group so that it can no longer pose any conceivable threat to their rule or interests.</p></blockquote></section>
