2017.</div><p>Malnutrition can arise in three forms:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/hunger-and-undernourishment/"><strong>hunger and undernourishment</strong></a>, which is defined as dietary energy intakes below the minimum levels necessary to achieve and maintain a healthy weight;</li>
<li><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/obesity/"><strong>obesity or overnourishment</strong></a>, which is defined as dietary energy intake which exceeds requirements for maintenance of a healthy bodyweight;</li>
<li><strong>micronutrient deficiencies</strong>, which is defined as a lack of essential vitamins and minerals required in small amounts by the body for proper growth and development.</li>
</ul><p>This data entry focuses on micronutrient deficiencies; our entries on undernourishment and obesity can be found at the links above.</p><p>In contrast to macronutrients (energy, protein and fat), micronutrients are vitamins and minerals which are consumed in small quantities, but are nonetheless essential for physical and mental development. Essential micronutrients include (but are not limited to): iron, zinc, calcium, iodine, vitamin A, B-vitamins, and vitamin C.</p><p>Micronutrient deficiencies form an important global health issue, with malnutrition affecting key development outcomes including poor physical and mental development in children, vulnerability or exacerbation of disease, mental retardation, blindness and general losses in productivity and potential. Unlike energy-protein undernourishment, the health impacts of micronutrient deficiency are not always acutely visible; it is therefore sometimes termed &apos;hidden hunger&apos; (the two terms can be used interchangeably). &#xA0;The World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that more than<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0245e/x0245e01.htm#P38_2721" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> two billion people</a> suffer from micronutrient deficiency globally.</p><p>This entry explores global trends in key micronutrient deficiencies, potential health and development impacts, and progress in interventions to address vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</p></section>






<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical view</h2><p>Although any individual can experience micronutrient deficiency, pregnant women and children are at greatest risk of developing deficiencies. This is not only as a result of low dietary intake, but also from higher physiological requirements; pregnancy and childhood development often increases demand for specific vitamins and minerals.</p><p>The nutritional status of pregnant women is not only relevant for her own health, but can also have important consequences for the development of her child. Monitoring and addressing micronutrient deficiencies in both pregnant women and early childhood years is therefore essential for optimal development and health within a given population.</p><p>Data on deficiency prevalence, impacts and intervention strategies are therefore gathered most frequently for these specific demographics. Much of the content which follows is therefore focused on (but not limited to) malnutrition in pregnant women and children under the age of five.</p><h3 id="anemia-iron-or-vitamin-b12-deficiency"><a class="deep-link" href="#anemia-iron-or-vitamin-b12-deficiency"></a>Anemia (iron or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency)</h3><p>Anemia is a condition whereby an individual&apos;s blood lacks enough red blood cells (RBCs) to carry oxygen efficiently around the body. Anemia can result from a lack of iron or vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, although iron deficiency is the most common type.</p><p>Globally, anemia <a href="http://www.who.int/topics/nutrition/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affects more people</a> than any other health problem. Anemia has important implications for general productivity and development, reducing the work capacity of individuals by up to 20 percent. In more serious cases, anemia can lead to exacerbation of disease and illness. The World Health Organization estimate that 20 percent of maternal deaths are attributed to anemia alone.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><h4 id="anemia-in-pregnant-women"><a class="deep-link" href="#anemia-in-pregnant-women"></a>Anemia in pregnant women</h4><p>In the chart below we see the prevalence of anemia in pregnant women.&#xA0; Globally, around 40% of pregnant women are anemic.</p><p>The prevalence of anemia in pregnant women is typically lower in higher-income regions, being lowest in North America, and Europe &amp; Central Asia. Rates are particularly high across South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa; in some countries reaching over 60%.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/prevalence-of-anemia-in-pregnant-women-1995-2011" class="grapherPreview">

One metric which has been developed to give an indication of the severity of this is the Global Hidden Hunger Index (GHHI). Note that the terms &apos;hidden hunger&apos; and &apos;micronutrient deficiency&apos; are often used interchangeably. The GHHI is most commonly used to assess the nutritional status of pre-school children (under the age of five).</p><p>The GHHI is calculated as the average of three nutritional indicators in pre-school children: the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/hunger-and-undernourishment/#too-little-height-for-age-stunting">prevalence of stunting</a> (children who are too short for their age); the anemia; and vitamin-A deficiency. In the map below we see national GHHI values over the period 1999-2009.</p><p>Hidden Hunger is defined as &apos;alarming high&apos; across several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The remaining countries in these regions typically fall within the &apos;moderate-to-severe&apos; range. The majority of countries across Latin America, North Africa, Central Europe and East Asia are defined as having &apos;mild&apos; hidden hunger issues.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/global-hidden-hunger-index-in-pre-school-children" class="grapherPreview">

These are supplementation, food fortification and biofortification.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><ul>
<li><strong>Supplementation</strong>: supplementation is the delivery of concentrated micronutrients in pill, powder or liquid form;</li>
<li><strong>Food fortification</strong>: fortification is a subset of food processing and involves the addition of small amounts of micronutrients to food products often commonly consumed by the general population (such as cereals, wheat flours and rice);</li>
<li><strong>Biofortification</strong>: the use of agronomic and plant-breeding approaches in agriculture to increase the concentration of particular micronutrients in staple food crops. The most well-known example is so-called &apos;<a href="http://www.goldenrice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">golden rice</a>&apos;, which is rice grown with high concentrations of vitamin-A.</li>

Many countries try to tackle this issue by delivering vitamin-A supplements to children, in the form of high-dose capsules several times per year.</p><p>In the map below we see the coverage rate of vitamin-A supplementation in children aged between 6-59 months. This is defined to be sufficient if a child receives at least two high-dose capsules per year. In 2014, we see that the coverage rate of supplementation across many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia is very high--in many cases greater than 90 percent.</p><p>Although some countries still have very low rates of coverage, progress has been considerably over the last few decades. Since 1990, coverage rates in South Asia have nearly doubled, and since 2000, coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa has increased almost five-fold.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/vitamin-a-supplementation-coverage-rate-children-ages-6-59-months" class="grapherPreview">

Recognised as a driver in perinatal mortality, a leading cause of mental retardation (iodine deficiency can result in a mean IQ loss of 13.5 points in the population), and thyroid impairments, in the mid-1980s, the world committed to ending global iodine deficiency.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Iodine deficiency results from dietary intakes low in iodine; this typically occurs within populations with soils low in iodine content (thereby hindering iodine concentrations in crops). Iodine deficiency is therefore hard to address simply through dietary diversification.</p><p>The global solution to addressing deficiency has been through Universal Salt Iodization (USI) programmes. Salt is used as a delivery device for iodine for several reasons: it is widely consumed and has little seasonal variation; salt is typically distributed from a few centralised production centres; it has little impact on taste or texture of foods; and it is inexpensive (USI is estimated to cost US$ 0.02-0.05 per person per year).<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>Since the WHO and UNICEF recommended USI to address iodine deficiency, the world has made significant progress.

In the map below we see the share of households consuming iodized salt from 1993-2013. Overall, we see that many countries (even those of low income) have achieved levels between 60-100 percent. However, access across a handful of countries remains very low--in 2010 for example, less than 10 percent of households in Sudan and Mauritania consumed iodized salt.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/share-of-households-consuming-iodized-salt" class="grapherPreview">

Overall, we see that countries with lower GDP per capita experience more severe deficiency and malnutrition issues in children. This is <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/prevalence-of-anemia-in-women-of-reproductive-age-vs-gdp-per-capita">also true</a> of deficiency measures, such as the prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age.</p><p>Why is micronutrient deficiency more prominent at lower incomes? Since cereals tend to be less expensive than other food commodities, poorer households tend to have a more monotonous, energy-dense diet lacking in the dietary diversity required to meet micronutrient requirements.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> Richer households can instead afford to supplement staple food items with a diverse range of micronutrient-rich foods. </p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/hidden-hunger-index-vs-gdp-per-capita" class="grapherPreview">

These levels are typically derived based on biomarkers or signs and symptoms which are indicative of clinical disease or nutrient deficiency.</p><p>Nutrient requirements vary between individuals based on a range of factors, including age, sex, physical activity levels, and can be higher during periods of pregnancy, lactation, and disease. In individuals, specific requirement figures can be used based on their demographic profile. When assessing average requirements across groups or populations, requirements must be weighted based on the &quot;Estimated Average Requirement&quot; (EAR) of the individuals within the population. Distribution curves of intake and requirement can then be utilised to provide an estimate of the prevalence or risk of deficiency across the population.</p><p>The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) publish tables of nutrient requirement values across demographic groups [found <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42716/1/9241546123.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>].<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></section>
