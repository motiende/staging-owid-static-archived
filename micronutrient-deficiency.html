<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment/"><strong>hunger and undernourishment</strong></a>, which is defined as dietary energy intakes below the minimum levels necessary to achieve and maintain a healthy weight;</li>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/obesity/"><strong>obesity or overnourishment</strong></a>, which is defined as dietary energy intake which exceeds requirements for maintenance of a healthy bodyweight;</li>
<li><strong>micronutrient deficiencies</strong>, which is defined as a lack of essential vitamins and minerals required in small amounts by the body for proper growth and development.</li>
</ul><p>This data entry focuses on micronutrient deficiencies; our entries on undernourishment and obesity can be found at the links above.</p><p>In contrast to macronutrients (energy, protein and fat), micronutrients are vitamins and minerals which are consumed in small quantities, but are nonetheless essential for physical and mental development. Essential micronutrients include (but are not limited to): iron, zinc, calcium, iodine, vitamin A, B-vitamins, and vitamin C.</p><p>Micronutrient deficiencies form an important global health issue, with malnutrition affecting key development outcomes including poor physical and mental development in children, vulnerability or exacerbation of disease, mental retardation, blindness and general losses in productivity and potential. Unlike energy-protein undernourishment, the health impacts of micronutrient deficiency are not always acutely visible; it is therefore sometimes termed &apos;hidden hunger&apos; (the two terms can be used interchangeably). &#xA0;The World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that more than<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0245e/x0245e01.htm#P38_2721" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> two billion people</a> suffer from micronutrient deficiency globally.</p><p>This entry explores global trends in key micronutrient deficiencies, potential health and development impacts, and progress in interventions to address vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</p></section>






<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical view</h2><p>Although any individual can experience micronutrient deficiency, pregnant women and children are at greatest risk of developing deficiencies. This is not only as a result of low dietary intake, but also from higher physiological requirements; pregnancy and childhood development often increases demand for specific vitamins and minerals.</p><p>The nutritional status of pregnant women is not only relevant for her own health, but can also have important consequences for the development of her child. Monitoring and addressing micronutrient deficiencies in both pregnant women and early childhood years is therefore essential for optimal development and health within a given population.</p><p>Data on deficiency prevalence, impacts and intervention strategies are therefore gathered most frequently for these specific demographics. Much of the content which follows is therefore focused on (but not limited to) malnutrition in pregnant women and children under the age of five.</p><h3 id="anemia-iron-or-vitamin-b12-deficiency"><a class="deep-link" href="#anemia-iron-or-vitamin-b12-deficiency"></a>Anemia (iron or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency)</h3><p>Anemia is a condition whereby an individual&apos;s blood lacks enough red blood cells (RBCs) to carry oxygen efficiently around the body. Anemia can result from a lack of iron or vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, although iron deficiency is the most common type.</p><p>Globally, anemia <a href="http://www.who.int/topics/nutrition/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affects more people</a> than any other health problem. Anemia has important implications for general productivity and development, reducing the work capacity of individuals by up to 20 percent. In more serious cases, anemia can lead to exacerbation of disease and illness. The World Health Organization estimate that 20 percent of maternal deaths are attributed to anemia alone.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><h4 id="anemia-in-pregnant-women"><a class="deep-link" href="#anemia-in-pregnant-women"></a>Anemia in pregnant women</h4><p>In the chart below we have plotted trends in anemia prevalence in pregnant women from 1995-2011 by world region [this data can also be viewed by country using the &quot;add country&quot; button, or the &quot;map&quot; tab]. Over this period, global prevalence of anemia has declined by 5 percent, with a prevalence of 38 percent in 2011.</p><p>The prevalence of anemia in pregnant women is typically lower in higher-income regions, being lowest in North America, Europe &amp; Central Asia, and East Asia &amp; the Pacific.

One metric which has been developed to give an indication of the severity of this is the Global Hidden Hunger Index (GHHI). Note that the terms &apos;hidden hunger&apos; and &apos;micronutrient deficiency&apos; are often used interchangeably. The GHHI is most commonly used to assess the nutritional status of pre-school children (under the age of five).</p><p>The GHHI is calculated as the average of three nutritional indicators in pre-school children: the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment/#too-little-height-for-age-stunting">prevalence of stunting</a> (children who are too short for their age); the anemia; and vitamin-A deficiency.

These are supplementation, food fortification and biofortification.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><ul>
<li><strong>Supplementation</strong>: supplementation is the delivery of concentrated micronutrients in pill, powder or liquid form;</li>
<li><strong>Food fortification</strong>: fortification is a subset of food processing and involves the addition of small amounts of micronutrients to food products often commonly consumed by the general population (such as cereals, wheat flours and rice);</li>
<li><strong>Biofortification</strong>: the use of agronomic and plant-breeding approaches in agriculture to increase the concentration of particular micronutrients in staple food crops.

Recognised as a driver in perinatal mortality, a leading cause of mental retardation (iodine deficiency can result in a mean IQ loss of 13.5 points in the population), and thyroid impairments, in the mid-1980s, the world committed to ending global iodine deficiency.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Iodine deficiency results from dietary intakes low in iodine; this typically occurs within populations with soils low in iodine content (thereby hindering iodine concentrations in crops). Iodine deficiency is therefore hard to address simply through dietary diversification.</p><p>The global solution to addressing deficiency has been through Universal Salt Iodization (USI) programmes. Salt is used as a delivery device for iodine for several reasons: it is widely consumed and has little seasonal variation; salt is typically distributed from a few centralised production centres; it has little impact on taste or texture of foods; and it is inexpensive (USI is estimated to cost US$ 0.02-0.05 per person per year).<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>Since the WHO and UNICEF recommended USI to address iodine deficiency, the world has made significant progress. More than 120 countries now have USI programmes, and it&apos;s estimated that 71 percent of households across the world have access to iodized salt.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a> Many countries have eliminated iodine deficiency as a public health issue.</p><p>Iodine deficiency remains a public health issue in some countries (particularly those of lower incomes). In the map below we see the share of households consuming iodized salt from 1993-2013. Overall, we see that many countries (even those of low income) have achieved levels between 60-100 percent. However, access across a handful of countries remains very low--in 2010 for example, less than 10 percent of households in Sudan and Mauritania consumed iodized salt.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-households-consuming-iodized-salt" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-households-consuming-iodized-salt" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-of-households-consuming-iodized-salt_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="diarrhea-treatment-in-children"><a class="deep-link" href="#diarrhea-treatment-in-children"></a>Diarrhea treatment in children</h4><p>One impact of micronutrient deficiency is its potential to exacerbate existing disease and illnesses.

Diarrhea, especially in children, has important links to malnutrition. Malnutrition can serve to exacerbate the risk of mortality from diarrhea. Additionally, diarrhea affects the ability of children to retain and utilise nutrients properly--this means requirements for nutrient intake is higher than under normal circumstances.</p><p>Treating diarrheal disease is therefore a nutritional, as well as general health issue.

Micronutrient-rich foods include fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy, pulses, seafood, nuts and seeds. In contrast, cereal, root and tuber commodities tend to be energy-dense but micronutrient-poor.</p><p>In the chart below we have plotted the hidden hunger index in children (on the y-axis) versus the share of dietary energy attained through the consumption of cereals, roots and tubers. Overall, we see that countries where the average diet is rich in micronutrient-poor cereals tend to have higher levels of micronutrient deficiency (here shown as hidden hunger in children).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/hidden-hunger-index-vs-share-of-energy-intake-from-cereals-roots-and-tubers" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/hidden-hunger-index-vs-share-of-energy-intake-from-cereals-roots-and-tubers" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/hidden-hunger-index-vs-share-of-energy-intake-from-cereals-roots-and-tubers_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="micronutrient-deficiency-is-more-severe-at-lower-incomes"><a class="deep-link" href="#micronutrient-deficiency-is-more-severe-at-lower-incomes"></a>Micronutrient deficiency is more severe at lower incomes</h3><p>In the chart below we have plotted the Hidden Hunger Index in pre-school children (on the y-axis) versus gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, measured in 2011 international-$ (on the x-axis).

These levels are typically derived based on biomarkers or signs and symptoms which are indicative of clinical disease or nutrient deficiency.</p><p>Nutrient requirements vary between individuals based on a range of factors, including age, sex, physical activity levels, and can be higher during periods of pregnancy, lactation, and disease. In individuals, specific requirement figures can be used based on their demographic profile. When assessing average requirements across groups or populations, requirements must be weighted based on the &quot;Estimated Average Requirement&quot; (EAR) of the individuals within the population. Distribution curves of intake and requirement can then be utilised to provide an estimate of the prevalence or risk of deficiency across the population.</p><p>The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) publish tables of nutrient requirement values across demographic groups [found <a href="http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42716/1/9241546123.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>].<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></section>
