<li><em><strong>Tuberculosis</strong></em>, <em><strong>HIV/AIDS</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Malaria</strong></em>: the three infectious diseases which currently cause most deaths worldwide.

<section><h2 id="what-makes-a-disease-eradicable"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-makes-a-disease-eradicable"></a>What makes a disease eradicable?</h2><p>It is not possible to clearly draw a line between eradicable and non-eradicable diseases. Diseases only became eradicable after scientific discoveries gave us the tools to fight them.</p><p>However two conditions are absolutely necessary for a disease to be eradicable and there are several characteristics of diseases which make it more likely for a disease to be eradicable.</p><h3 id="two-necessary-conditions"><a class="deep-link" href="#two-necessary-conditions"></a>Two necessary conditions</h3><p><strong>1. It is an infectious disease</strong></p><p>For a disease to be eradicable it needs to be a disease you can &quot;catch&quot;, for example from other humans or animals, i.e. it has to be infectious. Non-infectious diseases, such as heart disease or cancer,&#xA0;cannot be eradicated.</p><p><strong>2. Measures against the disease exist</strong></p><p>To eradicate a disease we need to know of measures to fight its spread. The summary table above illustrates the diversity of such means against diseases.</p><p>Whilst the characteristics of a disease are biologically-determined or fixed, the available measures against the disease can progress through our scientific understanding and technological developments. This is where human ingenuity makes the fight against a disease possible. We discuss the different types of measures against infectious diseases next.</p><h3 id="the-means-to-fight-the-spread-of-diseases"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-means-to-fight-the-spread-of-diseases"></a>The means to fight the spread of diseases</h3><p>Essential for the eradication of diseases is the development of means to fight their spread &#x2013; the second essential factor in the list above. Over the last centuries we have developed several means to fight the spread of infection and some of these have the potential to eradicate a specific disease entirely.</p><p>The appropriate measure to fight the disease depends on the type of pathogen and the way of transmission.&#xA0;For instance, antibiotics only work against bacteria, whilst anti-retrovirals only work against retroviruses. The way the disease is transmitted matters as well: if diseases spread via drinking water, filtering can stop the disease; if spread via mosquitoes, bed nets can stop the disease, etc.</p><h4 id="different-means-stop-different-pathogens"><a class="deep-link" href="#different-means-stop-different-pathogens"></a>Different means stop different pathogens</h4><p>The type of pathogen causing the disease is the first characteristic of a disease that informs the choice of appropriate measures against the disease.</p><p>These measures can be grouped into three categories, which are summarised in the figure below.</p><p>The appropriate measure depends on the specific disease. Both smallpox and rinderpest were eradicated using vaccines. However, vaccines have not been developed against every disease yet,&#xA0;so other methods like water decontamination, wound treatment and health education to block transmission can be used with great success as well, such as in the case of Guinea Worm (dracunculiasis).</p><h6>Measures against the spread of disease<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/Measures-against-disease-spread.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21019" src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/10/Measures-against-disease-spread-635x550.png" alt="Measures against disease spread" width="635" height="550" srcset="/uploads/2018/10/Measures-against-disease-spread-150x130.png 150w, /uploads/2018/10/Measures-against-disease-spread-400x346.png 400w, /uploads/2018/10/Measures-against-disease-spread-635x550.png 635w, /uploads/2018/10/Measures-against-disease-spread-768x665.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p><strong>Different transmission routes of the disease require different strategies</strong></p><p>The list below &#x2013; based on Checchi (2009)<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> &#x2013; describes the routes of transmission for all diseases discussed in this article (<strong>bold</strong>) and a number of other common infectious diseases.</p><p><em>Direct transmission routes (suitable for ring-vaccination)</em></p><ul>

</ul><p>For those diseases that spread through direct contact between people &#x2013; those listed under direct-transmission routes &#x2013; the <strong>ring-vaccination principle&#xA0;</strong>can be applied. It allows to only vaccinate all people who came or will come in contact with an infected person, rather than vaccinating the whole population, to save money and time. This principle was successfully applied for the eradication of smallpox.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></section>
























<section><h2 id="successfully-eradicated-diseases"><a class="deep-link" href="#successfully-eradicated-diseases"></a>Successfully eradicated diseases</h2><h3 id="smallpox"><a class="deep-link" href="#smallpox"></a>Smallpox</h3><p>Below we provide a summary of the eradication of Smallpox; you can find more detailed information in our much more detailed full&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smallpox entry</a>.</p><p>Smallpox was one of the most lethal and feared diseases in history<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> caused by the variola major or minor viruses. It exclusively infected humans.</p><p>Symptoms included&#xA0;fever, vomiting, and the development of a rash covering the body that would turn into fluid-filled pustules. These pustules later formed scabs which eventually fell off to leave behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#/media/File:Child_with_Smallpox_Bangladesh.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large and very visible scars</a>.</p><p>Smallpox was a disease that spread via droplets when infected patients sneezed or coughed. The virus could more rarely spread via the clothes or bed sheets of infected people. Patients would be contagious for approximately 20 days, from the onset of the first rash until the last pustule falling off as a scab.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p>While an infection of the variola minor virus would lead to death with a probability of less than 1%, the case fatality rate of the variola major virus has been estimated to be around 30%.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>Thanks to the early discovery of a vaccine and global efforts, smallpox was completely eradicated in 1977. It was the first and until today the only human disease to be eradicated.</p><h4 id="means-against-the-disease"><a class="deep-link" href="#means-against-the-disease"></a>Means against the disease</h4><p>Accounts of mankind&apos;s search for a means against smallpox date back as far as the accounts of the disease itself. A practice in China and India dating back to 1,000BC involved the nasal insufflation of dried and crushed scabs of smallpox patients&apos; pustules.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>In England, a practice called &apos;inoculation&apos; or &apos;variolation&apos; became widespread in the 1720s&#xA0;which involved the injection of pus extracted from smallpox patients&apos; pustules under an uninfected person&apos;s skin. The inoculated patient would usually suffer a minor smallpox infection and subsequently be immune against an infection.</p><p>Because both practices made use of the live variola virus the practices came with two serious disadvantages: First, for a certain time period inoculated patients were carriers of the disease themselves and could potentially further spread the virus. Second, the patients were at risk of actually contracting the disease and some died as a consequence of the procedure that was intended to protect them.</p><p>In 1796, the English doctor Edward Jenner discovered that inoculating his patients with the cowpox virus which was of the same family as the variola virus protected them against smallpox.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a>&#xA0;Cowpox was a much milder and not lethal disease which made the procedure much safer for its recipients. It is the Latin word for cow,&#xA0;<em>vacca</em>, that gave rise to the name of this new practice:&#xA0;<em>vaccination</em>.</p><div>There was no treatment to cure smallpox when the disease still occured.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></div><h4 id="the-history-of-smallpox-eradication"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-history-of-smallpox-eradication"></a>The history of smallpox eradication</h4><p>Smallpox was extremely deadly in the past. The data for London shown below suggests that 7.6 out of a 100 deaths in London prior to 1800 were caused by smallpox. In other words, around 1 in 13 deaths was due to smallpox.</p><p>As is typical for viral diseases against which no means existed, smallpox deaths fluctuated regularly over the course of a few years. This occurred because by the time the virus had infected a population, it either engendered immunity or death, so a renewed outbreak in a subsequent year would not infect as many people. The impact of Jenner&#x2019;s invention of the cowpox vaccine in 1796 is clearly visible in the time-series as it had a remarkably fast and pronounced effect on the number of smallpox deaths in London from the beginning of the 19th century onwards.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-in-london" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-smallpox-in-london" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/deaths-from-smallpox-in-london_v4_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>However, it was not until 1980 that the World Health Organization would certify that the world had been freed of smallpox and ordered the destruction of variola virus samples in all but two high security labs. After its invention in 1796, vaccination still had to gain in prominence and improvements to the production and resilience of vaccine serum had to be made.</p><p>It was only with the establishment of the World Health Organization in the aftermath of World War II that international quality standards for the production of smallpox vaccines were introduced and the fight against smallpox moved from national to an international agenda. In 1966, the WHO launched the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program. By then&#xA0;smallpox cases and deaths in Europe and North America had been driven down substantially but large parts of Asia and Africa still struggled under smallpox&apos;s disease burden.</p><p>The number of smallpox cases is shown by world region in the chart below. Shown here is the number of reported smallpox cases from 1920 until the last case in 1977. Even though smallpox had a high visibility and should therefore be relatively easy to document, the lack of an international organization dedicated to global health means the number of reported cases will possibly be substantially lower than the true total number of cases. Fenner et al. (1988) write &quot;it is not unreasonable to regard the official figures reported to WHO as representing only 1-2% of the true incidence - probably nearer 1% for the years before the initiation of the global eradication programme.&quot;<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> They go on by estimating that in the early 1950s - where the documented cases peaked with 546,000 cases in 1951 - there were actually 50 million smallpox infections every year and that by 1967 - a year in which 121,000 cases were reported - there were probably still 10-15 million infections around the world.

Inspired by the success of smallpox&apos;s eradication in 1977, the GPEI declared polio&apos;s eradication its mission. Since then, the organization has provided countries at risk of or still endemic with polio with support for national immunization campaigns and for monitoring and reporting systems.</p><p>Due to polio&apos;s spread via the fecal-oral route, it is unfortunately not suitable for a ring vaccination strategy like smallpox was. This is because the virus is able to survive outside the human body (in faeces, ground water, etc.) for several weeks and can therefore travel substantial distances before &quot;needing&quot; another human body for survival again. To break the chain of transmission of polio and to eventually eliminate it, a population needs to have a sufficiently high vaccination coverage which can only be achieved through mass immunization campaigns.</p><p>The chart below highlights the global decline of the&#xA0;<em>estimated</em> number of paralytic polio cases&#xA0;from 1980 onwards. In the peak year 1981, the number of paralytic polio cases are estimated to have exceeded 450,000 but were reduced to 43 cases in 2016 - a more than 100,000-fold reduction of paralytic polio cases.&#xA0;India has been the last country to eliminate polio in 2011, so in 2017 the polio virus was endemic in three countries only: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-estimated-paralytic-polio-cases-by-world-region" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-estimated-paralytic-polio-cases-by-world-region" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/number-of-estimated-paralytic-polio-cases-by-world-region_v9_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="guinea-worm-dracunculiasis"><a class="deep-link" href="#guinea-worm-dracunculiasis"></a>Guinea worm (dracunculiasis)</h3><p>Guinea worm is a disease caused by the worm <em>Dracunculus medinensis,&#xA0;</em>therefore it is also called dracunculiasis.

The bacterium infects humans and non-human primates. The name framboesia is derived from lesions that resemble raspberries (French: framboise).<a id="ref-46" class="ref" href="#note-46"><sup>46</sup></a></p><p>Within 90 days of being infected, patients develop symptoms in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lesions</a> which completely disappear again within six months. A second round of lesions erupt months to years later, also healing off again within six months but likely leaving behind scars. In approximately 10% of <em>untreated</em> cases, a third round of lesions can occur and result in complications such as destruction of skin, bones and cartilage. The Oxford Textbook of Medicine describes yaws as &quot;rarely fatal&quot;.<a id="ref-47" class="ref" href="#note-47"><sup>47</sup></a></p><p>Yaws is spread by&#xA0;skin-to-skin&#xA0;contact and rarely via objects, by bacteria entering through broken skin.

It is back on the WHO&apos;s list of diseases to be eradicated by 2020. This is believed feasible because effective antibiotics exist against yaws. The required mass treatments are relatively easy and cheap to administer. However, many countries do not monitor and report yaws cases to the WHO so that the global number of cases and thereby progress towards eradication remains largely unknown.<a id="ref-49" class="ref" href="#note-49"><sup>49</sup></a></p><h4 id="eradication-of-other-diseases-means-against-the-disease"><a class="deep-link" href="#eradication-of-other-diseases-means-against-the-disease"></a>Means against the disease</h4><p>The spread of the <em>Treponema pallidum</em> bacterium can be fought in two ways; improved hygiene and health education as well as antibiotic treatment.

Recently, new diagnostic tests have been developed that can diagnose a yaws infection faster and more accurately.<a id="ref-52" class="ref" href="#note-52"><sup>52</sup></a> This is important as the correct antibiotics could be immediately prescribed to confirmed yaws patients and avoid unnecessary oversubscription of antibiotics to patients suffering from similar symptoms caused by different pathogens.</p><h4 id="the-road-towards-yaws-eradication"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-road-towards-yaws-eradication"></a>The road towards yaws eradication</h4><p>The history of yaws eradication efforts illustrates the importance of political support, which we listed as the last of the five &quot;features that make eradication easier&quot; in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#five-features-which-make-eradication-easier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section VIII</a>. After all, yaws ticks all the other boxes of our five features: it is caused by only one subspecies of bacteria, only infects humans and non-human primates, good and cheap means against and diagnostics for yaws exist and both India and Ecuador have successfully interrupted transmission. The reason why yaws has not been eradicated yet is &quot;simply&quot; that for a long time, yaws has been neglected; no eradication campaigns were run and no records of case numbers were kept. Even today, only eight countries report yaws cases to the WHO.</p><p>The disease-causing pathogen of yaws was identified in 1905 but it was not until the establishment of the World Health Organisation in the aftermath of World War II that antibiotics were tested as a treatment option.<a id="ref-53" class="ref" href="#note-53"><sup>53</sup></a> Anecdotal evidence suggests that the disease burden prior to the WHO efforts was extremely high: In what today constitutes Ghana in 1936, 62.7% of all infectious diseases treated in government health facilities were yaws cases (for comparison, malaria only accounted for 20.3%).<a id="ref-54" class="ref" href="#note-54"><sup>54</sup></a> It has been estimated that in 1955, there were 50 million yaws cases worldwide.<a id="ref-55" class="ref" href="#note-55"><sup>55</sup></a></p><p>Therefore, after a few pilot projects that tested the efficacy of the antibiotic penicillin, the WHO together with UNICEF launched mass treatment campaigns in 46 countries in 1952. By 1964, after screening approximately 300 million people and administering approximately 50 million penicillin doses to patients and their close contacts, yaws cases were said to be reduced by 95% to just 2.5 million cases. In light of such a successful reduction in yaws&apos;s disease burden, internationally coordinated mass campaigns were discontinued and countries&apos; primary health care systems were tasked with the elimination of the last 5% of cases. Global interest faded, developing countries&apos; healthcare systems already had too much on their plate and since no records were kept anymore, nobody knew how yaws numbers were developing.</p><p>It was only with a WHO review of its Neglected Tropical Diseases in 2012 that yaws regained international attention. The WHO even declared it its goal of eradicating yaws by 2020.</p><p>These renewed eradication efforts make use of a different antibiotic called azithromycin (described in the previous section) that can be administered orally. A new strategy is to give azithromycin to everyone living in a yaws-prone community, regardless of whether they suffer from yaws or not.<a id="ref-56" class="ref" href="#note-56"><sup>56</sup></a></p><p>To achieve the eradication of yaws, better monitoring in endemic countries as well as determining the endemicity status of all remaining countries will be necessary. For instance, it is unclear whether the disease is still in circulation in the Americas today.<a id="ref-57" class="ref" href="#note-57"><sup>57</sup></a> The world map below visualised the only data available - a country&apos;s status of endemicity in 2016 and the number of cases for a few countries that reported yaws infections to the WHO. 14 countries are known to be endemic, even though for many more countries (all those shown in yellow) it is unknown whether yaws is still in circulation.

Whilst the currently available means against the disease (with sufficient investment) can feasibly reduce the number of TB cases and deaths to very low numbers (a 95% reduction from 2015 case numbers is targeted by 2035), the <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/strategy/end-tb/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHO</a> and <a href="http://www.stoptb.org/assets/documents/global/plan/GlobalPlanToEndTB_TheParadigmShift_2016-2020_StopTBPartnership.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stop TB Partnership</a> note that means are not yet available to completely eradicate the disease.

Firstly, patients with active cases need to be isolated (<em>(2) Disease Transmission</em>) and treated (<em>(1) Infected individuals</em>). Soon after the start of treatment, patients are not infectious anymore which prevents the further spread of tuberculosis. The third method is preventative protection in the form of a vaccine&#xA0;(<em>(3) Exposed individuals</em>) called BCG (bacille Calmette-Gu&#xE9;rin).</p><p>The first method, isolating tuberculosis patients, requires an accurate and speedy diagnosis, both of which is currently not available.&#xA0;The most common test is quick and cheap but misses roughly 50% of cases while the most accurate and currently available test requires 10 to 40 days for a diagnosis.<a id="ref-82" class="ref" href="#note-82"><sup>82</sup></a></p><p>The second method &#x2013; curing patients with active tuberculosis &#x2013; involves taking antibiotics, usually daily for 6 to 12 months. However, some strands of the TB bacterium have developed a resistance to many or all antibiotics currently available. This is known as multi-drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis.</p><p>The third method, to prevent people from falling ill with TB in the first place, makes use of the only vaccine currently available, named BCG after its two French inventors&#xA0;Calmette and Gu&#xE9;rin. Unfortunately, it only&#xA0;protects 50% of vaccinated people, a low effectiveness compared to other vaccines that typically protect 85-100% of vaccinated people.<a id="ref-83" class="ref" href="#note-83"><sup>83</sup></a> Research into a better vaccine is therefore ongoing.<a id="ref-84" class="ref" href="#note-84"><sup>84</sup></a>&#xA0;Additionally, people with latent TB can also be treated with antibiotics which kills the <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>&#xA0;they carry and prevents it from becoming active and contagious. The danger of treating people that are not sick with TB (yet) with antibiotics, however, is that it could make the problem of TB bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics worse. Before prescribing antibiotics to latent TB cases,&#xA0;public health systems would therefore need to administer TB tests first to determine who is a carrier of the bacteria and who is not.</p><p>The WHO&apos;s End TB Strategy and Stop TB Partnership have <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/post2015_TBstrategy.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set ambitious goals</a> in addressing the global burden of TB: SDG Target 3.3 requires a 80 percent reduction in TB cases (and 90 percent reduction in deaths) from 2015 levels by 2030; by 2035, the goal is to achieve a 90 percent reduction in cases (95 percent reduction in deaths). To achieve this, progress rates will have to shift rapidly: current rates of a 1.5 percent decline in incidence per year <a href="http://www.stoptb.org/assets/documents/global/plan/GlobalPlanToEndTB_TheParadigmShift_2016-2020_StopTBPartnership.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would have to accelerate</a> to 10 percent per year. The <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/post2015_TBstrategy.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHO estimates</a>&#xA0;a US$2.3 billion per year funding gap to achieve this, but that the tools and treatments are available to achieve these targets with adequate funding.</p><p>Whilst its technically feasible to achieve the End TB targets of a 95 percent reduction in deaths and 90 percent in incidence (from 2015 levels) by 2035, new tools are needed if we are to completely eradicate this disease. The <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/post2015_TBstrategy.pdf?ua=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WHO estimates</a> a US$1.2 billion per year funding gap in research for new TB-combating tools.

When a patient is infected with bacteria that do not respond to the two most powerful anti-tuberculosis drugs, rifampicin and isoniazid, their infection is classed as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). If on top of that, a patient is also resistant to a third type of common anti-tuberculosis drug, fluoroquinolones, and at least one alternative drug, a so-called second-line agent, the patient suffers from extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis.<a id="ref-85" class="ref" href="#note-85"><sup>85</sup></a></p><p>In 2016, there were approximately&#xA0;<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis-without-extensive-drug-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300,000 people worldwide</a> that developed MDR-TB, which corresponds to 3.3% of all new active tuberculosis infections that year.

<li>Removing a disease from the list of existing diseases makes doctor&apos;s lives easier and patient&apos;s lives better by <strong>reducing the chance of mis-diagnoses</strong>.</li>
<li>No medication is needed to treat an eradicated disease. This <strong>slows the emergence of resistance</strong>. Take for example the (hypothetical) eradication of a bacterial disease. No more antibiotics will be used to treat cases (and suspected cases) of this disease. The reduced usage of antibiotics will slow the spread of resistance to antibiotics.<a id="ref-105" class="ref" href="#note-105"><sup>105</sup></a></li>
<li>A disease that is eradicated can also <strong>no longer</strong> mutate or re-combine with other pathogens to <strong>form novel diseases</strong>.</li>
<li>The final benefit is&#xA0;<strong>saving cost in the long term</strong>. In several ways eradicating a disease reduces expenditure in the future:<a id="ref-106" class="ref" href="#note-106"><sup>106</sup></a>
<ul>
<li>The direct effect is that the eradication reduces the costs of prevention and treatment.</li>
<li>The indirect effect is that it decreases spending on diagnosing the disease and research into the disease.</li>
<li>Lastly, there is also the effect of having a more healthy population that as a consequence is more productive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><p>Therefore eradication has economic benefits <em>in the long term</em> as more money is saved than the eradication campaign costs.

In reality there are distinct biological features of the organisms and technical factors of dealing with them that make their potential eradicability more or less likely.&#x201D;</em><a id="ref-108" class="ref" href="#note-108"><sup>108</sup></a></p><p><strong>1. The disease is caused by only a small number of pathogens</strong></p><p>Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens. These disease-causing microorganisms include bacteria, viruses, unicellular parasites, or larger parasites such as worms. We included them for all diseases discussed here in our summary table at the beginning of this entry. To eradicate a disease its pathogen needs to be eradicated. This means that diseases caused by one or a small number of pathogens are easier to eradicate than the ones caused by a larger number of pathogens. Examples make this clear:</p><ul>
<li>Smallpox, for instance, is caused by only two types&#xA0;of viruses that were eradicated in 1977 using a vaccine.</li>
<li>Lung infections, on the other hand, are an example of a disease named after their shared symptom: infection of the lung. But these symptoms can be caused by a large number of viruses and bacteria. This makes the disease &quot;lung infection&quot; non-eradicable.&#xA0;Wound infections are an even more extreme example as they can be caused by many bacteria that would not be harmful to a healthy human with intact skin.</li>
</ul><p>In other words, disease-causing organisms can be eradicated but not necessarily symptoms.</p><p><strong>2. The disease has only one host</strong></p><p>Diseases that only infect one species will be easier to eradicate than diseases that infect many species, i.e. that have &quot;alternative hosts&quot;. Smallpox, for instance, was caused by a virus that only survived in and spread among humans.</p><p>Other diseases that have only humans as a host are:</p><ul>
<li>polio,</li>
<li>Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis),</li>
<li>measles,</li>
<li>mumps,</li>
<li>pertussis (whooping cough), and</li>
<li>diphtheria.</li>
</ul><p>Many diseases unfortunately either rely on several hosts (vector-transmitted) or can even have several hosts as alternative reservoirs:</p><p>Malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and river blindness are examples of&#xA0;<strong>vector transmitted</strong>&#xA0;diseases. This means that the pathogen&#xA0;<em>requires several&#xA0;hosts</em> in its life cycle. The malaria parasite, for instance, needs both humans and certain types of mosquitos to survive.&#xA0;In a hypothetical scenario of all humans being cleared of malaria at the same time, mosquitoes could still carry the disease and re-infect humans. However, if all humans could somehow be protected from infections for a few months at the same time, the malaria parasite would eventually die out as all malaria-carrying mosquitos naturally have a short life span. If the malaria parasite was therefore not able to live on in humans before the malaria-carrying mosquitoes die a natural death, the parasite would be eradicated.</p><p>The influenza virus (which causes influenza or &quot;the flu&quot;), is an example of a pathogen <strong>with several alternative hosts</strong>. The influenza virus can infect humans, birds, pigs and other animals. It&#xA0;could survive in these animals even if all humans were somehow made immune. This means that even if a vaccine against all strains of the influenza virus existed,&#xA0;one would still have to immunize all humans, pigs and even wild birds to eradicate influenza.</p><p>Other examples of diseases with alternative hosts are</p><ul>
<li>rinderpest (infected cattle, buffalo, zebras, water buffaloes,&#xA0;African buffaloes, elephants, kudu, wildebeest,&#xA0;various antelopes, bushpigs, warthogs, giraffes,&#xA0;sheep, and goats);</li>
<li>hepatitis A (which infects humans and other vertebrates);</li>
<li>ebola (infects bats as well as some bigger mammals);</li>
<li>rabies (infects all warm-blooded vertebrae including all mammals); and</li>
<li>Japanese encephalitis (a so-called <em>dead-end disease</em>&#xA0;in humans, sheep, and cattle, which means that it is fatal and cannot spread, and is only transmitted among pigs).</li>
</ul><p>While it makes eradication easier when there is only one host, we know it is not a requirement: Rinderpest was successfully eradicated in 2011 and it was a disease with alternative hosts that affected cattle, sheep and goats but also antelopes, buffaloes, deers, giraffs, wildebeests and warthogs. However, most cases occurred in domesticated animals so that eradication was achieved by vaccinating all domestic species in parallel.</p><p>Diseases that are vector transmitted will be easier to eradicate than those with alternative hosts, because one has to eradicate the pathogen from only one species for a sufficiently long time.</p><p>The fact that the pathogen is reliant on several hosts makes vector transmitted diseases easier to eradicate than diseases with several alternative hosts but harder to eradicate than diseases with just one host. In reality, more factors play a role in determining whether a disease is eradicable or not. Malaria, for instance, is a vector-transmitted disease but it is not currently eradicable because no good measures exist against it (the second point in the necessary factors for eradication in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#two-necessary-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section II.1</a>).</p><p><strong>3. The disease is visible and good diagnostics exist</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>Good monitoring of outbreaks is essential for eradicating a disease as it allows us to contain an outbreak and prevent the spread of the disease.</p><p>If the disease has visible symptoms in the majority of infections or when a good diagnostic method exists, monitoring is easier. A smallpox infection, for instance, always led to visible pox and made monitoring simple.&#xA0;Pictures of infected people were shown and allowed health workers to find cases even in remote villages.<a id="ref-109" class="ref" href="#note-109"><sup>109</sup></a></p><p>Less visible diseases are harder to monitor. If symptoms only show in a minority of infections (e.g. polio) or if a diagnosis is difficult the disease can more easily spread unnoticed.</p><p>Another aspect that makes monitoring harder is if a disease is stigmatized. Sexually transmitted diseases for example might be hidden from the community intentionally.</p><p><strong>4. Elimination has proven possible</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>It is promising if a disease has already been eliminated from certain geographical areas such as islands or even whole world regions.<a id="ref-110" class="ref" href="#note-110"><sup>110</sup></a> If, on the other hand, no country has ever eliminated a disease, it is likely that the current means against a disease are not effective enough yet to make eradication possible.<a id="ref-111" class="ref" href="#note-111"><sup>111</sup></a></p><p>Once a geographic region or indeed most countries worldwide have eliminated a disease, eradication becomes a feasible target.&#xA0;Currently there are three diseases that fall in this category: Polio, Guinea worm disease, and yaws. Because elimination of these diseases has been achieved these diseases are discussed in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#eradication-of-other-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">section IV: Eradication of other diseases</a> above.</p><p><strong>5. The perceived disease burden is high and financial, political and community support are available.</strong></p><p>The perceived burden of a disease, the estimated cost of eradication, and the political stability of affected countries are further factors that determine the eradicability of diseases.</p><p>Polio is a good example here as it illustrates the powerful impact of both a unified international effort and local political support. In 1988, the <em>Global Polio Eradication Initiative</em> was set-up which has provided large-scale and, importantly, continued support for the eradication of polio. The number of paralytic polio cases has been greatly reduced such that in 2018 it is considered endemic in only three countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.</p><p>But polio also illustrates that positive developments might reverse. Nigeria&#x2019;s case numbers, for instance, surged from 202 in 2002 to 1143 in 2006 because of suspicions that immunization campaigns were a cover for Muslim sterilization by the US government which lead to an 11-month boycott.<a id="ref-112" class="ref" href="#note-112"><sup>112</sup></a> The example of polio hence illustrates the importance of both international as well as local community support for eradication.</p></section>

The former, usually abbreviated to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> is the main pathogen responsible for tuberculosis in humans but can also infect many other species, including dogs, non-human primates and cattle.(National Research Council, 1994) <em>M. bovis</em>, in turn, is the main pathogen responsible for tuberculosis in cattle but also infects humans and all other mammals. The WHO (2017) estimates that 147,000 new human tuberculosis infections were due to <em>M. bovis</em>, which corresponds to approximately 1.6% of the total 9 million new infections that year. Humans used to catch <em>M. bovis</em> infections from cattle more frequently by consuming contaminated meat or milk but thanks to better food testing and the pasteurization of milk, the vast majority of human tuberculosis cases originate from <em>M. tuberculosisÂ </em>(National Research Council, 1994).</p>

<p>There are five countries that managed to eliminate malaria between 1987 and 2007 (Armenia, Maldives, Morocco, Turkmenistan and the United Arab Emirates). However, neighboring countries of these still have malaria. While this is great news, malaria is not yet eradicable. Pathogens do not respect boarders, therefore the time malaria will be considered eradicable will be once a whole geographic region has eliminated the disease.</p>
