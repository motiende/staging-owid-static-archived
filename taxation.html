class="contentAndFootnotes"><div class="article-content"><section><p>The way in which governments raise and spend revenue has a substantial impact on the economic and social development of nations. In this entry we analyze available data and empirical research on a prime source of government revenue: taxation.</p><p>While taxation is not the only source of government revenue, it is by and large the most important source in nearly all countries. According to the most recent estimates from the <a href="http://www.ictd.ac">International Centre for Tax and Development</a>, total tax revenues account for more than 80% of total government revenue in about half of the countries in the world &#x2013; and more than 50% in almost every country.</p><p>We begin this entry by providing an overview of historical changes in taxation patterns, and then move on to an analysis of available data from the last couple of decades, discussing recent trends and patterns in taxation around the world.</p><p>From a historical perspective, the growth of governments and the extent to which they are able to collect revenues from their citizens, is a striking economic feature of the last two centuries. The available long-run data shows that in the process of development, states have increased the levels of taxation, while at the same time changing the patterns of taxation, mainly by providing an increasing emphasis on broader tax bases.</p><p>Taxation patterns around the world today reveal large cross-country differences, especially between developed and developing countries. In particular, developed countries today collect a much larger share of their national output in taxes than do developing countries; and they tend to rely more on income taxation to do so. Developing countries, in contrast, rely more heavily on trade taxes, as well as taxes on consumption.</p><p>Moreover, the data shows that developed countries actually collect much higher tax revenue than developing countries despite comparable statutory taxation rates, even after controlling for underlying differences in economic activity. This suggests that cross-country heterogeneity in fiscal capacity is largely determined by differences in compliance and efficiency of tax collection mechanisms. Both of these factors seem to be affected by the strength of political institutions.</p><p>In the last part of this entry we provide an overview of empirical evidence regarding the equity and efficiency implications of taxation. In particular, we show that taxation does have a powerful redistributive effect, but it is important to consider how taxation also affects behavior of individuals, by changing economic incentives. For example, recent studies have found that taxation may lead to efficiency losses by inducing migration of &apos;super stars&apos;. These potential efficiency losses highlight the importance of designing taxation systems that achieve redistributive objectives at the smallest possible cost.</p></section>

                </figure><p>As we can see, until 1920 tax revenues were low across all these countries. Indeed, until 1910 less than 10% of national income was collected by these governments through taxation &#x2013; just enough for them to fulfil basic functions, such as maintaining order and enforcing property rights.</p><p>After the First World War, however, taxation started growing considerably. In the period 1920-1980 taxation as a share of national income increased drastically, more than doubling across all countries in the chart. These increases in taxation went together with more government expenditure on public services, particularly <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/financing-education#when-did-the-provision-of-education-first-become-a-public-policy-priority">education</a> and <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/financing-healthcare/#when-did-the-provision-of-healthcare-first-become-a-public-policy-priority">healthcare</a>.</p><p>After 1980, tax revenues started stabilizing, albeit with marked differences in levels for each country. Today these differences remain significant.</p><h4 id="income-taxation-played-a-fundamental-role-in-the-historical-expansion-of-tax-revenues"><a class="deep-link" href="#income-taxation-played-a-fundamental-role-in-the-historical-expansion-of-tax-revenues"></a>Income taxation played a fundamental role in the historical expansion of tax revenues</h4><p>The growth of tax revenues that took place in early-industrialized countries after the First World War was largely supported by the extension of income taxes.

In the first financial system, lasting from 1790 until about 1842, state governments played an important role in raising government revenue, mainly by generating &apos;asset income&apos; through activities such as the sale of land. In the second financial system, starting around 1840, local governments became more important, contributing an increasing share of government revenue from property taxes. And in the third system, starting with the Great Depression, the federal government became more important, generating increasingly larger revenues through the collection of income taxes.</p><p>The following visualization shows how this transition took place.

The table pools countries within groups, across two periods of time: 1990-1995 and 1996-2002. For each time-group pool of countries, the author ranks countries by tax revenue as share of national income, and reports the level for the country in the middle (i.e. the median tax revenue within that time-group pool). This gives us an idea of the &apos;typical&apos; country in that region, at that point in time.</p><p>As we can see, developed countries collect almost twice as much as developing countries in tax revenue. And developing countries, in turn, collect almost half as much as transition economies. Also, we can see that developed countries had little change in tax-to-GDP ratios in the second half of the 20th century, where as in developing countries there seems to be a broad negative trend.</p><h6>Central Government Tax Revenue as a Percentage of GDP, 1990&#x2013;1995 and 1996&#x2013;2002 &#x2013; Table 1 in Jha (2008)<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8817" src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-750x357.png" alt="regionaltaxrev_jha2008" width="750" height="357" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-150x71.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-400x190.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-750x357.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008-768x366.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegionalTaxRev_Jha2008.png 2012w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="which-forms-of-taxation-dominate-revenues-in-different-world-regions"><a class="deep-link" href="#which-forms-of-taxation-dominate-revenues-in-different-world-regions"></a>Which forms of taxation dominate revenues in different world regions?</h4><p>We have already discussed the fact that levels of taxation differ greatly across world regions &#x2013; both in levels and trends.

This measure, usually known as the &apos;top marginal rate of taxation&apos;, corresponds to the tax rate that applies to the &apos;last dollar&apos; of income earned by the rich.</p><p>The two visualizations below provide evidence of how top marginal income tax rates have evolved around the world.</p><p>The first graph shows top marginal rates in France, Germany, the US and the UK, for the period 1900-2013. As we can see, at the turn of the 20th century the top earners in these countries faced almost zero taxation on the last part of their incomes; but this changed drastically around 1910-1930, when high top marginal rates were introduced. Interestingly, however, this lasted only until about 1980, when again all countries substantially reduced rates. Today the levels are between half and a third of what they used to be at the highest point. In the UK, in 1978 the last pound of earned income at the highest bracket was essentially entirely taxed (98%). Today the corresponding figure is less than half (45%).</p><p>The second graph shows estimates of top marginal income tax rates for a larger selection of countries (years 1979 and 2002). As we can see, the sharp trend of reducing top marginal tax rates after the 1980s was a global phenomenon, expanding both developed and developing countries.</p><p>The interpretation of these graphs often leads to confusion. A common mistake is to interpret the top marginal tax rate as the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/taxation/#how-do-marginal-rates-of-taxation-compare-to-average-rates-of-taxation-in-the-us"><em>effective</em> rate of taxation</a> applied to the rich. This is incorrect, because the top marginal rate applies (as the &apos;marginal&apos; name suggests) only to the last portion of income earned by the rich. And by implication, lower marginal rates do not directly imply lower economic incidence of taxation for the rich.</p><p>Having said that, additional evidence does seem to suggest that the above-mentioned reduction of top marginal income tax rates has been one of the ingredients contributing to lower effective tax rates for the rich. We discuss this additional evidence in the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/taxation/#how-progressive-is-taxation-at-the-top-of-the-income-distribution-in-developed-countries">next section</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/top-income-tax-rates-piketty" class="grapherPreview">

This means that marginal rates apply only to the portion of taxable income that exceeds the lower income threshold for that marginal rate.</p><p>In contrast, the average, or effective rate of taxation is defined as the ratio of total taxes paid by total income earned &#x2013; that is, the share of income that is paid in income taxes.</p><p>The distinction between these two concepts is important because for many people, a portion of their income is taxed at one rate, and the rest is taxed at another rate. In the US, for example, if a married couple earns $40,000 a year, they pay federal income taxes at a rate of 10% on the first $18,500 or so, and at a rate of 15% on the rest. Hence, while the marginal rate applied to the last dollar earned is 15%, the effective income tax rate is lower.</p><p>Using the US federal income tax schedule, the following visualization shows the marginal and average rates for the income of married couples (filing jointly). These figures use estimated tax brackets for 2016 from the <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets">Tax Foundation</a>.</p><p>This visualization shows that average and marginal income tax rates are clearly different. Specifically, while both average and marginal rates are increasing, average rates are smoother and generally lower.</p><p>A similar chart showing marginal and average rates for the income of single individuals &#x2013; as opposed to married couples filing jointly &#x2013; can be found <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDsingles-750x525.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h6>Marginal and average tax rate on incomes in the US &#x2013; Our World in Data, with 2016 estimates from the <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets">Tax Foundation</a></h6><p><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8981" src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-750x525.png" alt="mrtvseffective_owidmarried" width="750" height="525" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-150x105.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-400x280.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-750x525.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried-768x538.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MRTvsEffective_OWIDmarried.png 3000w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h3 id="recent-trends-in-the-taxation-of-consumption"><a class="deep-link" href="#recent-trends-in-the-taxation-of-consumption"></a>Recent trends in the taxation of consumption</h3><h4 id="how-is-consumption-taxed"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-is-consumption-taxed"></a>How is consumption taxed?</h4><p>We have already outlined <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/taxation/#what-are-the-main-instruments-used-by-governments-to-collect-revenue">above</a> the main instruments used by governments to collect revenue.

This implies that, to assess who bears the burden of a tax, it is not sufficient to look at statutory tax rates. For example, if a tax is imposed on producers, in a competitive market they will raise prices to some extent to offset this tax burden &#x2013; so the producers&#x2019; income will not fall by the full amount of the tax. A similar argument can be made if the tax is levied on consumers, since in a market economy the tax will lower demand, and this will have a consequence also for producers.</p><p>The key point is that, in order to analyze the economic incidence of taxation in a market economy, we need to look beyond statutory tax rates.

To do this, they make the following assumptions: (i) Taxes on earnings are borne by workers; (ii) Taxes on individual income are borne by the households that pay them; (iii) Taxes on corporate income are borne by individuals in proportion to their capital income; (iv) Taxes on consumption are borne by individuals in proportion to their consumption.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p>Based on these assumptions, the CBO calculates total tax contributions as a share of pre-tax income for different segments of the pre-tax income distribution.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> These estimates, often referred to as &apos;average tax rates&apos;, can be interpreted as the effective rates of taxation that apply to individuals with different incomes, after accounting for government transfers (specifically cash payments and in-kind benefits from social insurance and other government assistance programs).</p><p>The following visualization, plotting CBO estimates of average tax rates, shows that the federal tax system in the US has been generally progressive: those located higher in the ranking of incomes, pay a higher share of their income in taxes.</p><p>Across time, we can also see that progressivity has not been constant &#x2013; the period 1980-1990 saw important reductions in tax rates for the rich, without comparable reductions for the poor.</p><p>The hike in tax rates towards the end corresponds primarily to significant changes in tax rules in 2012. Up until that point, and since around 1995, tax rates for the richest 1% went down every year (although they also went down for the lower income groups in the same period).</p><h6>Average federal tax rates, by before-tax income Group, 1979 to 2013 &#x2013; Figure 2 in CBO (2016)<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8856" src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-750x469.png" alt="usincidence_cbo" width="750" height="469" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-150x94.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-400x250.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-750x469.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO-768x480.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/USIncidence_CBO.png 2508w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="how-progressive-is-taxation-at-the-top-of-the-income-distribution-in-developed-countries"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-progressive-is-taxation-at-the-top-of-the-income-distribution-in-developed-countries"></a>How progressive is taxation at the top of the income distribution in developed countries?</h4><p>The visualization above shows that, according to the estimates from the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361">Congressional Budget Office</a>, richer individuals in the US generally tend to bear a larger burden of taxation than the poor. Here we examine whether this is also true within the top of the income distribution &#x2013; that is, whether the &apos;ultra rich&apos; shoulder a larger tax burden than the &apos;rich&apos;.</p><p>The next visualisation, from Piketty and Saez (2007)<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> shows estimated average tax rates in France, the US and the UK, at two points in time: 1970 and 2005. Notice that these are <em>average</em> rates (i.e. total tax contributions as a share of pre-tax income), <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/taxation/#how-do-marginal-rates-of-taxation-compare-to-average-rates-of-taxation-in-the-us">which are different to marginal tax rates</a>.</p><p>Displayed are rates for the bottom 90% of the income distribution, as well as higher percentiles. Again, we can see in these estimates that the systems in question are progressive &#x2013; increasingly higher percentiles in the income distribution pay increasingly higher effective rates of taxation. However, the lines are much flatter in 2005, which shows that the systems have become less progressive at the top: the average share of income paid by those at the very top of the income distribution has dropped substantially since 1970. This is important because, as the authors of the figure point out, over the same period pre-tax income inequality grew significantly: a few very rich individuals at the very top are accumulating an increasingly large share of national incomes.</p><p>An important point that should be kept in mind is that these estimates are not directly comparable to those from the Congressional Budget Office discussed above, because they do not take into account government transfers, and rely on different methodological assumptions &#x2013; for example, they do not consider excise taxes (but they do consider estate taxes).

Here we provide evidence suggesting that political factors &#x2013; such as the extent of institutionalized constraints on the decision-making powers of policy makers &#x2013; help shape the level and evolution of fiscal capacity of countries.</p><p>The following chart, from Besley and Persson (2013)<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a>, plots the cross-country relationship between political institutions and tax revenues. The authors approximate the strength of political institutions by calculating the proportion of years since independence (or since 1800 if independence is earlier) that a country had strong constraints on the executive. Having &apos;strong constraints on the executive&apos;, in turn, is measured from the well-known Polity IV data base (you can read about measurement and definitions in the <a href="http://home.bi.no/a0110709/PolityIV_manual.pdf">Polity IV dataset users&#x2019; manual</a>). In essence, this variable aims to capture the extent to which accountability groups impose institutionalized constraints on the decision-making powers of policy makers.</p><p>The scatter plot controls for baseline differences in GDP &#x2013; that is, what we observe is the correlation between tax revenues and political institutions conditional on GDP levels. As we can see, countries with strong executive constraints collect higher tax revenues, when income per capita is held constant, than do countries with weak executive constraints.</p><p>Some studies suggest that, under weak accountability, countries may not only have generally weak taxation systems, but may also be subject to &#x2018;political budget cycles&apos; whereby tax collection declines prior to elections, as politicians seek to secure short-term political support (See Prichard 2016<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a> and the references therein for more details).</p><h6>Tax revenue vs constraints on executive authority</h6><p><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8840" src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-730x550.png" alt="taxes_institutions_besley2013" width="730" height="550" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-150x113.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-400x301.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-730x550.png 730w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013-768x578.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Taxes_Institutions_Besley2013.png 1538w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="aid-correlates-negatively-with-tax-revenue-but-the-link-does-not-seem-to-be-causal"><a class="deep-link" href="#aid-correlates-negatively-with-tax-revenue-but-the-link-does-not-seem-to-be-causal"></a>Aid correlates negatively with tax revenue, but the link does not seem to be causal</h4><p>A large body of academic literature has studied the relationship between revenue from development assistance (&apos;foreign aid&apos;) and revenue from taxation. The hypothesis supporting this strand of literature is straightforward: foreign assistance may &apos;crowd out&apos; domestic tax revenues, as it reduces the incentives for policy-makers to pursue politically costly tax collection.</p><p>This hypothesis seems to be supported by raw correlations. The following plot, from Benedek et al. (2014)<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a>, shows the evolution of tax revenues and foreign aid (Overseas Development Assistance &#x2013; ODA). It shows a broad negative association: between 1980 and 1995, when foreign aid as a share of GDP was increasing, average tax revenue in relation to GDP decreased slightly. Post-1995, a decline in the share of total net ODA to GDP was accompanied by higher tax revenues as percentage of GDP.</p><p>This relationship can not be interpreted causally, as there are many factors that simultaneously drive ODA flows and tax revenues. More complex econometric studies that try to account for further sources of bias find that there is no consistently significant relationship between aid and tax collection (see Prichard 2016<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a> and the references therein for more details).</p><h6>Average net development assistance and tax revenue in low and middle income countries, 1980&#x2013;2009 &#x2013; Figure 1 in Benedek et al.

The following visualization does this, showing the reduction of inequality that different OECD countries achieve through taxes and transfers.</p><p>The estimates correspond to the percentage point reduction in inequality, as measured by changes in the <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/income-inequality/#the-gini-coefficient">Gini coefficients</a> of income, before and after taxes and transfers. The source for the data is the 2008 OECD report <a href="http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/growingunequalincomedistributionandpovertyinoecdcountries.htm"><em>Growing unequal? </em></a> In this report you can find further details regarding how these estimates are constructed. In a nutshell, income &apos;before taxes&apos; corresponds to what is usually known as market income (wages and salaries, self-employment income, capital and property income); while income after taxes and transfers corresponds to disposable income (market income, plus social security, cash transfers and private transfers, minus income taxes).</p><p>The data shows that across the 24 countries covered, taxes and transfers lower income inequality by around one-third on average (equivalent to around 0.15 Gini points). Yet cross-country differences are substantial, with declines ranging from about 45% in Denmark and Sweden, to about 8% in South Korea. The US &#x2013; a country with high baseline levels of inequality &#x2013; achieves a reduction of around 17%, which is almost half of the OECD average.</p><p>Generally speaking, countries that achieve the largest redistribution through taxes and transfers tend to be those with the lowest after-tax inequality.</p><p>While informative for the purpose of cross-country comparisons, these results have to be interpreted carefully, since the before-tax distribution of incomes is already the result of choices made by individuals who take taxes and transfers into consideration. Put simply, the before-tax distributions of incomes are likely to be different to the actual distributions of incomes that would be in place if there were no taxes or transfers. This can be clearly explained in the context of pensions: individuals receiving state pensions appear in the data as poor before transfers; but many of them would of course have private pensions if they lived in a country without state transfers.</p><p>The extent to which taxes affect behavior is discussed in more detail <a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/taxation/#taxation-can-lead-to-efficiency-losses">below</a>.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/grapher/tax-reduction-in-inequality" class="grapherPreview">

For example, if a taxed good has a substitute that is not taxed, some consumers will shift to the substitute to avoid the tax. These changes in behavior can lead to inefficiencies. For example, high tax rates may discourage labor supply; and in the case of very rich individuals, they may even induce migration of talent to countries where the tax burden is lower. In both cases, the &apos;size of the pie&apos; would be reduced by taxation. So how large are these behavioral responses?</p><p>Using data from the European football market, Kleven et al (2013)<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a> find evidence of strong mobility responses to taxation for &apos;superstars&apos;. The following scatter plots supports this.</p><p>The two plots correspond to different time periods. The vertical axis represents the fraction of all top-league professional football players who are foreign nationals in the country where they play, and the horizontal axis shows the average top earnings tax rate for foreign players in that country.</p><p>As we can see, in the period 1985-1995 there was no correlation between migration and tax rates; yet in the period 1996-2008, after the Bosman ruling on free mobility was enacted, the correlation became strongly negative: the countries with higher top earnings tax rates became less likely to have foreign players.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a> The authors also show that the mobility of players had a negative impact on the performance of football clubs of countries with high tax rates.</p><p>This evidence, suggesting that &apos;superstars&apos; are very responsive to taxation, contrasts with the available evidence for typical individuals &#x2013; while still highly debated, most empirical estimates suggest that for the majority of the population, labor supply choices are not very responsive to changes in income tax rates (see Saez et al. 2012<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a> for a review of the literature).</p><h6>Cross-country correlation between tax rates and migration of football players &#x2013; Figure 1 in Kleven et al (2013)<a id="ref-31" class="ref" href="#note-31"><sup>31</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8862" src="https://staging-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-750x346.png" alt="footballtaxes_-kleven_etal2013" width="750" height="346" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-32x32.png 32w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-50x50.png 50w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-64x64.png 64w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-96x96.png 96w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-128x128.png 128w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-150x69.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-400x184.png 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-750x346.png 750w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013-768x354.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FootballTaxes_-Kleven_etal2013.png 2044w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p></section>









































<section><h2 id="data-quality-measurement"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-measurement"></a>Data Quality &amp; Measurement</h2><p>The most widely used global data source on taxation is the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/aboutgfs.htm">IMF Government Finance Statistics (GFS) </a>. This is the source used to produce the <a href="http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators&amp;preview=on">World Development Indicators</a> from the World Bank, and is an input for the production of many other related, but different sources of information, including (i) the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database.htm"> OECD Tax Statistics dataset</a>; (ii) the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/ctp/revenue-statistics-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean-24104736.htm">OECD Revenue Statistics in Latin America dataset</a>; and (iii) the <a href="http://estadisticas.cepal.org/cepalstat/web_cepalstat/Portada.asp?idioma=i">CEPALSTAT Revenue Statistics in Latin America database</a></p><p>Combining data from all these sources, the <a href="http://www.ictd.ac">International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD)</a> produces the ICTD <a href="http://www.ictd.ac/datasets/the-ictd-government-revenue-dataset">Government Revenue Dataset</a>.</p><p>The data produced by the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD and CEPAL often covers different countries at different points in time; and for those years and countries in which estimates overlap, there are significant inconsistencies.</p><p>The inconsistencies between sources are often due to differences in methodological choices &#x2013; such as differences in the classification of social security contributions, or the omission of data from taxes collected by local governments. And in addition to methodological differences, sources also seem to differ in other substantial non-systematic ways. A very detailed account of data quality differences can be found in Prichard et al. (2014).<a id="ref-32" class="ref" href="#note-32"><sup>32</sup></a></p><p>The following chart shows an example of data discrepancies in tax revenues for Ghana.
