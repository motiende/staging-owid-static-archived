Life expectancy&#xA0;differed massively between ages&#xA0;in 1845 &#x2013; from 40 years for newborns to 79 for 70-year olds. Today the difference in life expectancies between these age groups&#xA0;is much smaller; Newborns can expect to live until age 81 to, and 70-year olds to age 86. This is because the chance of dying at a younger age has been steadily decreasing, which means that the&#xA0;equality of life expectancy across ages has increased.</p><h6>Total life expectancy in the UK by age, 1541-2001 &#x2013; Max Roser<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a>

</h6><h3 id="inequality-by-socio-economic-class"><a class="deep-link" href="#inequality-by-socio-economic-class"></a>Inequality by socio-economic class</h3><p>In absolute terms the inequality of life expectancy has decreased massively in the UK &#x2013; the visualisation above showed that the Gini for life expectancy has declined from over .45 to below .1 in the beginning of the 21st century.</p><p>We can see below that the gap in infant mortality has narrowed significantly in absolute terms; there were 80 infant deaths per 1,000 live births for infants with fathers who were in unskilled manual fields, versus 32 deaths per 1,000 live births born to fathers with professional careers, representing a&#xA0;2.5 times lower rate. Today, those absolute mortality numbers are only 7.4 and 3.8 respectively, but there is still nearly a two-fold difference in mortality rate. Absolute inequality&#xA0;has&#xA0;decreased dramatically, but the ratio between the two &#x2013; a measure of&#xA0;relative inequality &#x2013; has only decreased a little.</p><p>When considering how the inequality of child mortality has decreased, one has to take into account that the occupational structure has also changed &#x2013; the share of people employed in the low-skilled sector has decreased. The authors of the data below &#x2013; Floud, Fogel, Harris, Hong &#x2013; add that the &quot;differences are still apparent even after allowances have been made for the effects of changes in the occupational structure of the British population and selection effect&quot;.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><h6>Infant mortality rates of both sexes by father&#x2019;s social class in England and Wales, 1930/2-2001<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a>

There is much debate about what the best system is. One study from Gruber et al (2014) analyzes a 2001 healthcare reform in Thailand called &quot;30 Baht&quot;. The program increased funding to hospitals to care for the poor and decreased copays to 30 Baht, which is approximately $0.75 USD. The study suggests that the program increased healthcare utilization especially among the poorest, and infant mortality was significantly reduced. After the implementation of 30 Baht, the correlation between the wealth of the Thai province and infant mortality reduced to nearly 0.&#xA0;<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></section>

<p>(The Human Mortality Database data refers to remaining life expectancy for people in a 5 year age bracket (10-14, 15-19, ...). To calculate total life expectancy I have added the lower bound of each range to the remaining life expectancy for the given age group – the values here should therefore be understood as the lower bound for total life expectancy.)</p></li><li id="note-4"><p>For the source see the next citation.</p></li><li id="note-5"><p></h6>
