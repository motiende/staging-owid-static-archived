Indeed, for a long time the world population grew at an increasing rate. However, if we focus on the last couple of decades, we see that this pattern no longer holds, as the annual rate of population growth has been recently going <em>down</em>. 1962 saw the growth rate peak at 2.1%, and it has since fallen to almost half. A long historical period of accelerated growth has thus come to an end.</p><p>Based on these observations, world history can be divided into three periods marked by distinct trends in population growth. The first period, pre-modernity, was a very long age of very slow population growth. The second period, beginning with the onset of modernity&#x2014;which was characterized by rising standards of living and improving health&#x2014;had an increasing growth rate that continued to rise through 1962. Today, the second period is over, and the third period is unfolding; the population growth rate is falling and will likely continue to fall, leading to an end of population growth towards the end of this century.</p></section>

The following visualization presents the annual population growth rate superimposed over the total world population for the period 1750-2010, as well as projections up to 2100. This is the period in history when population growth changed most drastically. Before 1800, the world population growth rate was always well below 1%. Over the course of the first fifty years of the 20th century, however, annual growth increased to up to&#xA0;2.1%&#x2014;the highest annual growth rate in history, which was recorded in 1962. Since peaking, the growth rate has systematically been going down, with projections estimating an annual rate of 0.1% for 2100.</p><p>This means that while the world population quadrupled in the 20th century, it will not double in the 21st century.</p><h6>World population, 1750-2015 and projections until 2100<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9433" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-750x525.png" alt="updated-world-population-growth-1750-2100" width="750" height="525" srcset="/uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-32x32.png 32w, /uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-50x50.png 50w, /uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-64x64.png 64w, /uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-96x96.png 96w, /uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-128x128.png 128w, /uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-150x105.png 150w, /uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-400x280.png 400w, /uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-750x525.png 750w, /uploads/2013/05/updated-World-Population-Growth-1750-2100-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h3 id="long-run-historical-perspective"><a class="deep-link" href="#long-run-historical-perspective"></a>Long-run historical perspective</h3><h4 id="world-population-from-10-000-bce-to-2100-ce"><a class="deep-link" href="#world-population-from-10-000-bce-to-2100-ce"></a>World Population from 10,000 BCE to 2100 CE</h4><p>The chart below shows the the increasing number of people living on our planet over the last 12,000 years.

As the growth rate slowly climbed, the population doubling time fell but remained in the order of centuries into the first half of the 20th century. Things sped up considerably in the middle of the 20th century. The fastest doubling of the world population happened between 1950 and 1987: a doubling from 2.5 to 5 billion people in <em>just 37 years</em> &#x2014; the population doubled within a little more than one generation. This period was marked by a peak population growth of 2.1% in 1962.</p><p>Since then, population growth has been slowing, and along with it the doubling time. In this visualisation we have used the UN projections to show how the doubling time is projected to change until the end of this century. By 2088, it will once again have taken nearly 100 years for the population to double to a predicted 11 billion.</p><h6>Time it took for the world population to double<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12378" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-750x525.png" alt="World population doubling time 1" width="3000" height="2100" srcset="/uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-32x32.png 32w, /uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-50x50.png 50w, /uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-64x64.png 64w, /uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-96x96.png 96w, /uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-128x128.png 128w, /uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-150x105.png 150w, /uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-400x280.png 400w, /uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-750x525.png 750w, /uploads/2017/04/World-population-doubling-time-1-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="time-taken-for-population-to-increase-by-one-billion"><a class="deep-link" href="#time-taken-for-population-to-increase-by-one-billion"></a>Time taken for population to increase by one billion</h4><p>The visualisation below provides an additional perspective on population growth: the number of years it took to add one billion to the global population.

<p>Today, global fertility is barely higher than the global replacement fertility. The replacement fertility is the total fertility rate at which the population size stays constant. If there were no mortality in the female population until the end of the childbearing years, the replacement fertility would be exactly 2. With the <a title="Child Mortality" href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality/">current level of mortality</a> the global replace fertility is 2.3 – the narrow gap between the current global fertility and the global replacement rate means that the <a title="World Population Growth" href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/world-population-growth/">increase of the world population</a> is due to the <a title="Life Expectancy" href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/life-expectancy/">increasing length of life</a> and population momentum. Population momentum occurs – <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/depweb/english/modules/social/pgr/index02.html">as the World Bank explains</a> – "when a large proportion of a country’s population is of childbearing age. Even if the fertility rate of people in developing countries reaches replacement level, that is if couples have only enough children to replace themselves when they die, for several decades the absolute numbers of people being born still will exceed the numbers of people dying."</p>
<p>--></p><h4 id="population-projections-based-on-education-levels"><a class="deep-link" href="#population-projections-based-on-education-levels"></a>Population projections based on education levels</h4><p>The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) is an interdisciplinary, highly-respected research institution near Vienna, Austria. The IIASA population projections are the most cited alternative to the UN work.</p><p>Interestingly, their medium projection for population growth (which they consider most likely) stands in stark contrast to the UN projection. While the medium variant of the UN projection sees the world population growing continuously throughout the 21st century, the IIASA medium scenario sees the world population increase to 9.4 billion in 2070, and then begin a slow decline to reach below 9 billion by the end of the century.</p><p>As the IIASA researchers explain, there are <a href="http://blog.iiasa.ac.at/2014/09/23/9-billion-or-11-billion-the-research-behind-new-population-projections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">important methodological differences</a> between the UN and IIASA projections. The UN uses probabilistic population projections to extrapolate populations for each country over the 21st century and applies the same statistical methodology to all countries. In contrast, the IIASA researchers have a country-specific approach that takes into account the knowledge of experts for each country separately.</p><p>The other important feature of the IIASA projection is that it takes into account how educated a given population is. As we show below, there is a strong link between education and <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/fertility/">fertility</a>&#x2014;more educated women have fewer children. This link is factored into IIASA&apos;s model and contributes to their projection of a much smaller total world population over the course of the 21st century.</p><p>Breaking down the population by education level is especially interesting: we see that our world will be inhabited by more and more educated people. The visualization below shows that in 1970 there were only around 700 million people in the world who had secondary or post-secondary education. By the end of this century, the number of people with secondary or post-secondary education will have increased 10-fold and will reach 7 billion people (a figure similar to the entire current world population)!</p><p>The projection also shows that the number of people with no education will decrease continuously and that by the end of this century virtually all people in the world will have received some level of education.</p><figure data-grapher-src="/grapher/projection-of-world-population-SSP2-IIASA" class="grapherPreview"><a href="/grapher/projection-of-world-population-SSP2-IIASA" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/projection-of-world-population-SSP2-IIASA_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="how-will-the-global-demography-change"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-will-the-global-demography-change"></a>How will the global demography change?</h3><p>At times when the population pyramid actually resembles a pyramid people are facing the risk to die at any point in their life. The uniform narrowing of the pyramid to the top is evidence of the continuous risk of death from birth on and through all ages. The visualisation here shows this was still the global reality in 1950 &#x2013; the narrowing of the pyramid just above base is testimony to the fact that <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/child-mortality/#child-mortality-globally-post-1950">in 1950 every fourth child died</a> before it reached the age of five. The continuing narrowing to the top shows the high mortality throughout all ages.</p><p>At a time when the top of the pyramid is much wider and the pyramid increasingly resembles a box shape, the population lives through young ages with very low risk of death and dies at an old age. The box shape is the demographic structure of a healthy population. The projection in the visualisation shows that the global demography changes from the pyramid to the box shape &#x2013; the world population through all ages is becoming increasingly healthier.</p><p>In addition to mortality it is also fertility that shapes the form of the demographic structure. The first aspect that matters for the number of new births in a population is the fertility rate, the number of births per woman in the reproductive age. But if there are only few women in reproductive age the number of births will be low even with a high fertility rate. Therefore the age structure of women in a population matters too &#x2013; specifically it is the share of women in the reproductive age that determines the number of births. A bulge of women in this age keeps the number of birth high even when fertility is already low, this is what demographers refer to as &#x2018;population momentum&#x2019;. The pyramid for 2016 shows that the largest cohort of women today are the very young women. The last decades of population growth have left us with a bulge of population in the childbearing ages. For this reason the world population will continue to increase, even as the fertility rate of the world is falling to the replacement level fertility.</p><h6>The World Population Pyramid in 1950, 2017 and 2100<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15302" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-750x525.png" alt="World population pyramid 1950 to 2100" width="750" height="525" srcset="/uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-32x32.png 32w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-32x32.png 32w, /uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-50x50.png 50w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-50x50.png 50w, /uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-64x64.png 64w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-64x64.png 64w, /uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-96x96.png 96w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-96x96.png 96w, /uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-128x128.png 128w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-128x128.png 128w, /uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-150x105.png 150w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-150x105.png 150w, /uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-400x280.png 400w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-400x280.png 400w, /uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-750x525.png 750w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-750x525.png 750w, /uploads/2017/10/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-768x538.png 768w, /uploads/2017/12/World-Population-Pyramid-1950-to-2100-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="the-world-is-reaching-peak-children"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-world-is-reaching-peak-children"></a>The world is reaching peak children</h4><p>A second aspect to note regarding the age structure of the world population is how the very young population will change. Here we can see that at the end of the century the base of the structure is narrower than today. There will be fewer children born at the end of this century than today.</p><p>The world is approaching what the late Hans Rosling called &#x201C;the age of peak child&#x201D;. The solid purple line in the visualisation below indicates the total population of people under the age of 5, and the dotted purple line shows projections for this age group through 2100. As we can see, we are not far away from the largest cohort of children that there will likely ever be. The gray lines show the total world population &#x2013; we expect an end to population growth as the number of children in the world begins to decrease.</p><p>This is an extraordinary moment in global history. In the past only two children per woman reached adulthood &#x2013; if more had survived the population size would have not been stable. This also means that the extended family with many children, that we often associate with the past, was only a reality for glimpse in time. Only the few generations during the population boom lived in families with many children &#x2013; before and after two children are the norm. The future will resemble our past, except that the children are not dying, but are never born in the first place.</p><p>Between 1950 and today it was mostly a widening of the entire pyramid that was responsible for the increase of the world population. What is responsible for the increase of the world population from now on is not a widening of the the base, but a fill up of the population above the base. Not children will be added to the world population, but people in working age and old age.</p><p>At a country level &#x201C;peak child&#x201D; is followed by a time in which the country benefits from a &#x201C;demographic dividend&#x201D;. The demographic structure of a country is reshaped so that the proportion of people in working age rises and that of the dependent young generation falls. The demographic dividend can result in a rise of productive contributions and a growing economy.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a> Now there is reason to expect that the world as a whole benefits from a &quot;demographic dividend&quot;.</p><p>The big demographic transition that the world entered more than a century ago is coming to an end: Global population growth has peaked half a century ago, the number of babies is reaching its peak, and the age profile of the women in the world is changing so that &#x2018;population momentum&#x2019; is slowly losing its momentum. This is not to say that feeding and supporting a still rising world population will be easy, but we are certainly on the way to a new balance where it is not like in our long past when high mortality kept population growth in check, but when it is low fertility that will keep the world population from growing.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-population-and-projected-growth-to-2100-by-age-group" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/world-population-and-projected-growth-to-2100-by-age-group" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/world-population-and-projected-growth-to-2100-by-age-group_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>

And in the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/fertility/">entry on fertility</a> we show how socio-economic changes over the course of modernization &#x2013; a decline of child mortality, structural changes to the economy, and a rise of the status and opportunities for women &#x2013; all contribute to a very substantial reduction of fertility.</p><p>But this alone would not explain why the size of the population increases. What is missing from the picture is the timing at which mortality and fertility changes.</p><p>The model in which this information comes together is called the &#x2018;demographic transition&#x2019;. It is shown in the schematic figure. The model explains the changing size of the total population as driven by the birth and the death rate of the population. It is a beautiful simple model that describes the pattern that we observe in countries around the world and is one of the great insights of demography.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>The five stages of the transition are described below and are illustrated in the graph that follows:</p><ul>
<li>Stage 1: In the long time before modern population growth the birth rate is high, but since the death rate is also high we observe no population growth. This describes the reality through most of our history. Societies around the world remained in stage 1 for millennia.</li>
<li>Stage 2: Then in the second phase the health slowly starts to improve and the death rate is dropping. Since the health of the population has already improved, but fertility still remains as high as before, this is the stage of the transition at which the population increases rapidly. Families do not yet adapt their fertility to the low mortality and have many children.
<p>Historically it is the exceptional time at which the extended family with many children is common.</p></li>
<li>Stage 3: This is when fertility declines as a result of the social changes: Parents realise that as progress kick in the mortality of children is not as high as it once was and they therefore opt for fewer births, the economy is undergoing structural changes that makes children less economically valuable, and women are empowered socially and within partnerships. The fertility rate is declining steeply.</li>
<li>Stage 4: The population growth comes to an end and in stage 4 as the birth rate catches up with the low mortality rate.</li>
<li>Stage 5: The demographic transition describes changes over the course of socio-economic modernization. What happens at a very high level of development is still not a settled question since only few societies have reached this stage. But we do have some good evidence &#x2013; which we review in the entry on fertility <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/fertility/#fertility-is-first-falling-with-development-and-then-rising-with-development">here</a> &#x2013; that at very high levels of development fertility is rising again. Not to the very levels of the pre-modern times, but to a fertility rate around 2. As a consequence of this the natural population growth rate will be at 0% or possibly slightly above.</li>

The demographic transition works through the asynchronous timing of the two fundamental demographic changes: The decline of the death rate is followed by the decline of birth rates.</p><p>This decline of the death rate followed by a decline of the birth rate is something we observe with great regularity and independent of the culture or religion of the population.</p><p>The chart below presents the empirical evidence for the demographic transition for five very different countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In all countries we observed the pattern of the demographic transition, first a decline of mortality that starts the population boom and then a decline of fertility which brings the population boom to an end. The population boom is a temporary event.</p><p>In the past the size of the population was stagnant because of high mortality, now country after country is moving into a world in which the population is stagnant because of low fertility.</p><h6>Demographic transition in 5 countries, 1820-2010<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi.png" rel="attachment wp-att-7305" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7305" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-742x550.png" alt="Demographic-Transition-5-countriesi" width="742" height="550" srcset="/uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-32x32.png 32w, /uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-64x64.png 64w, /uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-96x96.png 96w, /uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-128x128.png 128w, /uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-150x111.png 150w, /uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-400x296.png 400w, /uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-742x550.png 742w, /uploads/2013/05/ourworldindata_demographic-transition-5-countriesi-768x569.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h4 id="england-and-wales-s-demographic-transition"><a class="deep-link" href="#england-and-wales-s-demographic-transition"></a>England and Wales&apos;s demographic transition</h4><p>Perhaps the longest available view of the demographic transition comes from data for England and Wales. In 1981, Anthony Wrigley and Roger Schofield<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> published a major research project analyzing English parish registers&#x2014;a unique source that allowed them to trace demographic changes for the three centuries prior to state records. According to the researchers, &quot;England is exceptionally fortunate in having several thousand parish registers that begin before 1600&quot;; collectively, with their early start and breadth of coverage, these registers form an excellent resource. As far as we know, there is no comparable data for any other country up until the mid-eighteenth century (see the following section for <a href="#sweden-s-demographic-transition">Sweden</a>, where recordkeeping began in 1749).</p><p>The chart below shows the birth and death rates in England and Wales over the span of nearly 500 years. It stitches together Wrigley and Schofield&apos;s data for the years 1541-1861 with two other sources up to 2015 (click on the chart&apos;s &apos;sources&apos; tab for details). As we can see, a growing gap opens up between the birth and death rate after 1750, creating a population explosion. Around the 1870&apos;s, we begin to see the third stage of the demographic transition. As the birth rate starts to follow the death rate&apos;s decline, that gap between the two starts to shrink, slowing down the population growth rate.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/the-demographic-transition-in-england-and-wales" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/the-demographic-transition-in-england-and-wales" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/the-demographic-transition-in-england-and-wales_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="sweden-s-demographic-transition"><a class="deep-link" href="#sweden-s-demographic-transition"></a>Sweden&apos;s demographic transition</h4><p>Zooming in on one of these countries, we take a look at Sweden&#x2019;s demographic transition. The country&apos;s long history of population recordkeeping&#x2014;starting in 1749 with their original statistical office, &#x2018;the Tabellverket&#x2019; (Office of Tables)&#x2014;makes it a particularly interesting case study of the mechanisms driving population change.</p><p>Statistics Sweden, the successor of the Tabellverket, publishes data on both deaths and births since recordkeeping began more than 250 years ago. These records suggest that around the year 1800, the Swedish death rate started falling, mainly due to improvements in health and living standards, especially for children.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> Yet while death rates were falling, birth rates remained at a constant pre-modern level until the 1860s. During this period and up until the first half of the 20th century, there was a sustained gap between the frequency of deaths and the frequency of births. It was because of this gap that the Swedish population increased. The following visualization supports these observations.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/Demographic-Transition-Mitchell" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/Demographic-Transition-Mitchell" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/Demographic-Transition-Mitchell_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="changes-to-birth-and-death-rate-over-time-around-the-world"><a class="deep-link" href="#changes-to-birth-and-death-rate-over-time-around-the-world"></a>Changes to birth and death rate over time around the world</h4><p>The visualization presents the birth and death rate for all countries of the world over the last 5 decades.

These estimates are revised periodically and aim to be consistent and comparable within and across countries and time.</p><p>The methodology used by the UN to produce their estimates and projections is explained extensively in the World Population Prospects&apos; <a href="http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2015_Methodology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Methodology Report</a>.</p><p>In short, estimates of the population in the past (i.e. 1950-2015) are produced by starting with a base population for 1 July 1950 and computing subsequent populations based on the components that drive population change (fertility, mortality, and international migration). The estimates of these components are taken directly from national statistical sources or&#x2014;where only partial or poor-quality data exists&#x2014;are estimated by the Population Division staff. Population counts from periodic censuses are used as benchmarks. This calculation is called the &quot;cohort-component&quot; method because it estimates the change in population by age and sex (cohort) on the basis of the three afore-mentioned demographic components (component): fertility, mortality, and international migration.</p><p>The process of &apos;revising&apos; the estimates involves incorporating new information about the demography of each country. The following diagram explains the process used to ensure consistency.</p><h6>Process for generating UN population revisions &#x2013; Table I.4. in the UN World Population Prospects Methodology Report<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-7241" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7241" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-750x469.jpg" alt="UN Population Methodology" width="750" height="469" srcset="/uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-32x32.jpg 32w, /uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-64x64.jpg 64w, /uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-96x96.jpg 96w, /uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-128x128.jpg 128w, /uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-150x94.jpg 150w, /uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-400x250.jpg 400w, /uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-750x469.jpg 750w, /uploads/2016/03/ourworldindata_un-methodology-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p>One of the main implications of using the cohort-component method is that it sometimes leads to marked inconsistencies with official country statistics. The following map, which shows the coverage of births through civil registration, speaks to this issue: many countries, particularly those in the least developed regions of the world, have limited census data. For countries with no data in one or two decades before each revision, the UN derives estimates by extrapolating trends from countries in the same region with a socio-economic profile considered close to the country in question.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/completeness-of-birth-registration" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/completeness-of-birth-registration" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/completeness-of-birth-registration_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>For the completeness of death reporting, see <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/completeness-of-death-reporting?year=2010">here</a>.</p><h4 id="uncertainty-and-data-quality-of-related-measures"><a class="deep-link" href="#uncertainty-and-data-quality-of-related-measures"></a>Uncertainty and data quality of related measures</h4><p>The track record of projections of population growth is discussed in the entry on &apos;Future Population Growth&apos; <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/future-population-growth/#the-track-record-of-the-un-projections">here</a>.</p></section>
