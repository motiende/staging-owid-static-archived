<section><h2 id="polio"><a class="deep-link" href="#polio"></a>Polio</h2><h4 id="symptoms-and-transmission-of-polio"><a class="deep-link" href="#symptoms-and-transmission-of-polio"></a>Symptoms and transmission of polio</h4><p>Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is an infectious disease that is caused and transmitted by a virus called the poliovirus. One of the severe symptoms of polio is&#xA0;paralysis and the disease is therefore also known as &quot;infantile paralysis&quot;. The name poliomyelitis is derived from Greek and translates to gray (polios) marrow (myelon), which refers to the tissue in the center of the spinal cord, which when affected causes paralysis. Paralyzed limbs such as arms or legs waste away over time which is the cause of deformed child legs most commonly being associated with the disease polio.</p><p>Permanent paralysis fortunately occurs in only 0.5% of infections.&#xA0;The majority of infections (72%) do not lead to any symptoms. About a quarter of cases&#xA0;(24%) result in &#x201C;abortive&#x201D; poliomyelitis which leads to nonspecific symptoms for a few days, such as a fever or a cold, and 1-5% of cases lead to &#x201C;non-paralytic aseptic meningitis&#x201D;, in which the patient suffers from stiff limbs for up to 10 days.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>The poliovirus is found only among humans and is transmitted via the so-called fecal-oral route. In other words, polio is mostly transmitted by drinking water that has been contaminated by the feces of a person carrying the poliovirus. The virus therefore spreads especially well in conditions of poor sanitation, for example when people defecate in the open or do not filter their water before drinking it. The fact that the virus can only survive in humans (and no other animals) makes it possible to completely eradicate the disease from the world &#x2013; if it was a virus with an animal host such as influenza (birds) or tuberculosis (cows) that occasionally mutates to attack humans, polio could only ever be controlled but not eradicated.</p><p>Its relatively long incubation period of up to 10 days and three fourths of infections not showing any symptoms makes polio extremely difficult to monitor and the virus can spread for several months without being detected. Monitoring has to focus on identifying patients that suffer from symptoms or rely on stool samples.&#xA0;Because single identified cases might indicate larger outbreaks, the WHO recommends to treat such cases as a public health emergency when only one child is identified with a wild, endemic polio infection in a country that was previously declared polio free.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p><h4 id="fighting-polio-s-symptoms-the-iron-lung"><a class="deep-link" href="#fighting-polio-s-symptoms-the-iron-lung"></a>Fighting polio&apos;s symptoms: The &apos;Iron Lung&apos;</h4><p>Polio can lead to the death of infected patients when the paralysis is immobilizing their breathing muscles.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> To prevent the death by suffocation, Harvard professors Philip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw invented the so called &#x201C;iron lung&#x201D;<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> (pictured below) in 1928. Infected patients would be placed in an air-tight tube &#x2013; with their heads outside &#x2013; and the machine decreased the pressure inside the box, to induce inhalation, before returning to the normal outside pressure conditions, to induce exhalation.&#xA0;Most patients would spend one to two weeks in an iron lung before their paralytic symptoms faded and independent breathing was achieved once again. In the case of permanent paralysis, on the other hand, patients would be bound to live inside the iron lung for years.</p><p>As it is often the case with innovations, the iron lung became only widespread when the price declined substantially. John Emerson managed to construct an iron lung at half the cost in 1931. In the meantime, Philip Drinker had tried to protect his invention with a patent and therefore filed a lawsuit against Emerson for using the original iron lung set-up. Emerson did not succumb, claiming that life-saving devices should be made available to the public at low cost rather than be used for private financial gains, and in the end, Drinker&apos;s lawsuit failed.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>The falling price of the Iron Lung enabled mass distribution and widespread use from the end of the 1930s onwards. The cost of one iron lung in the 1930s amounted to US-$1,500, which is the equivalent of approximately US-$26,000 in 2016 when accounting for inflation.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> The design quickly spread to Western Europe and was widely used for polio patients there, too.</p><p>The data visualization further below, which shows the&#xA0;prevalence of polio in the US over the last century, shows two large outbreaks in 1916 and 1952. It can be seen that in 1916, before the widespread use of iron lungs, the death rate increased sharply when the case rate increased. But after the widespread use of iron lungs from 1939 onwards and during the largest polio outbreak in the US in the 1950s the death rate did not show the same strongly correlated increase anymore. This is because the breathing assistance of the iron lungs prevented the deaths of the many polio patients suffering from paralyzed breathing muscles &#x2013; the iron lungs were a large step forward in mankind&apos;s struggle against polio.</p><h6>A hospital room in the US with patients in iron lungs in 1952<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14453" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Ironlungs_Hospitalroom-733x550.jpg" alt="" width="733" height="550"></a></p></section>












<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical View</h2><h3 id="historical-perspective"><a class="deep-link" href="#historical-perspective"></a>Historical Perspective</h3><p>The history of polio can be divided into three major phases:<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><ul>
<li>The <em>endemic phase</em> from antiquity to the nineteenth century in which the disease occurred relatively rarely and did not result in many paralytic cases.</li>
<li>The <em>epidemic phase</em> until the mid-20th century, during which the world saw large-scale outbreaks and increased geographic spread.</li>
<li>And the <em>vaccine phase</em> that followed the introduction of vaccines in 1955. In this phase polio prevalence has been reduced first in richer countries and over the last decades in poorer countries around the world.</li>
</ul><p>The hope is that the world will see a fourth and&#xA0;final phase, in which polio is entirely eradicated from the planet.</p><h4 id="the-origin-of-polio"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-origin-of-polio"></a>The origin of polio</h4><p>Infectious diseases are generally believed to arise from the interplay of various developments such as humans&apos; settlement in urban structures, crowding that causes poor hygiene, food shortages enhancing populations&apos; morbidity, and the domestication of animals. The exact origins of the disease are not known, but based on the characteristics of the disease, epidemiologists are able to hypothesize how the disease has evolved and spread.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a> Because the disease requires a human host and does not survive outside the human body for longer than one to two weeks, the disease could only have developed when humans started to settle in larger agglomerations. Various skeletons have been found with deformations similar to polio<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a>&#xA0;but the most widely-referenced indication of polio&#xA0;has been an Egyptian stele (pictured below) depicting Doorkeeper Roma with one leg skinnier and deformed, both typical symptoms of paralytic polio.</p><h6>An Egyptian Stele dating back to 1403-1365 BC of a man with polio<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Egyptian_Stele.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14720 size-large" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Polio_Egyptian_Stele-391x550.jpg" alt="Polio Egyptian Stele" width="391" height="550"></a></p><h4 id="the-prevalence-of-polio-in-the-past"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-prevalence-of-polio-in-the-past"></a>The prevalence of polio in the past</h4><p>Since then, evidence of polio occurrences are scarce. But in different times records to polio-like diseases appear. The poet Sir Walter Scott was infected with polio at the age of eighteen months in 1773 and the disease paralyzed his right leg for life. In his <em>Treatise on the Diseases of Children</em> in 1789 the London pediatrician Michael Underwood writes about a children&apos;s disease, possibly polio, that is a &quot;debility of the lower extremities&quot;.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p>Known outbreaks in the 19th century recorded no more than 30 cases as can be seen in the table below, taken from Smallman-Raynor &amp; Cliff (2006).<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><h6>Polio-like outbreaks in the 19th century<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></h6><p><div class="tableContainer"><table class="tablepress"><thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Location</th><th>Cases (deaths)</th></tr></thead><tbody class="row-hover"><tr><td>1808</td><td>G&#xF6;teborg, Sweden</td><td>4 (-)</td></tr><tr><td>1835</td><td>Worksop, UK</td><td>4 (-)</td></tr><tr><td>1841</td><td>Louisiana, USA</td><td>10 (-)</td></tr><tr><td>1868</td><td>Modums, Norway</td><td>14 (4)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p><h4 id="polio-in-the-epidemic-phase"><a class="deep-link" href="#polio-in-the-epidemic-phase"></a>Polio in the epidemic phase</h4><p>Up to the 19th century, populations experienced only relatively small outbreaks. This changed around the beginning of the 20th century. Major epidemics occurred in Norway and Sweden around 1905 and later also in the United States.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p>Why did we see such large outbreaks of polio only in the 20th century?&#xA0;Or, in other words, why did the transition from the <em>endemic</em> to the <em>epidemic</em> phase take place?</p><p>The answer, again, lies with hygiene standards. As polio is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, the lack of flush toilets and the lack of safe drinking water meant that children in the past were usually exposed to the poliovirus before their first birthday already. At such a young age, children still benefit from a passive immunity that is passed on from their mothers in the form of antibodies. These are proteins that identify the poliovirus as something foreign and therefore signal to the body that they should be eliminated (done by either the antibodies themselves or different cells called macrophages). Thereby, virtually all children would contract the poliovirus at a very young age. While protected from developing the disease thanks to the maternal antibodies, their bodies would produce their own memory cells in response to the virus and that ensured long-term immunity against polio. The latter is important as the mother&apos;s cells have a half-life of only 30 days (starting from the last day of breastfeeding).<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> Once the maternal antibodies decrease in number, children lose their passive immunity.</p><p>As hygiene standards improved, the age at which children were first exposed to the poliovirus increased and this meant that the maternal antibodies were no longer present to protect children from polio.</p><p>That improved sanitation was a driving factor in polio outbreaks is also illustrated by the fact that the age at which polio was contracted increased over time. During five US epidemics in the time period 1907-1912, most reported cases occurred in one- to five-year-olds, whereas during the 1950s the average age of contraction was 6 years with &quot;a substantial proportion of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults&quot;.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> Being exposed to the poliovirus after losing the protection from maternal antibodies meant that they were more likely to get polio, resulting in an increase in case and death numbers around the turn of the 19th and 20th century.</p><h4 id="the-history-of-polio-in-the-us"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-history-of-polio-in-the-us"></a>The history of polio in the US</h4><p>The chart below shows the annual absolute number of reported deaths and cases in the United States over the last century; the corresponding perspective on the <em>rate</em> of deaths and cases is shown in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-polio-rates-in-the-united-states-1910-2010">this visualization</a>. Big outbreaks happened frequently. In 1916 for example, the poliovirus infected more than 27,000 Americans and killed more than 7,000 people.&#xA0;At that time, the cause and spread of the disease was not yet known, so panicked New Yorkers shut down schools, public cinemas, and swimming pools. For a while it was believed that cats or mosquitoes were spreading the virus which lead to the killing of more than 72,000 cats and the extensive spraying of the insecticide DDT, in a futile attempt to interrupt the transmission of the virus.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>Each of these large outbreaks came to an end because, like most viral diseases, the spread of the poliovirus in moderate climates like in the USA is seasonal and is mostly transmitted during the summer months. By October 1916, enough New Yorkers had been infected and developed immunity in response so that in combination with the natural seasonal decline of the virus&apos;s spread the case numbers had already dramatically dropped and would not surge again. This can be seen in the graph as the US recorded less than 5,000 cases in&#xA0;the following year. Containing the second major outbreak in the USA in the 1950s, on the other hand, was largely aided by the successful development of polio vaccines that would hinder the transmission of the virus.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="the-vaccine-against-polio"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-vaccine-against-polio"></a>The vaccine against polio</h3><h4 id="the-development-of-the-polio-vaccine"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-development-of-the-polio-vaccine"></a>The development of the polio vaccine</h4><p>What changed the history of polio forever was the development of a vaccine against the disease. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself had been diagnosed with polio at the age of 39 and subsequently bound to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. While this might have been a misdiagnosis in Roosevelt&apos;s case,<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> his presidential influence was crucial in the set-up of the&#xA0;<em>National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis</em>. The non-profit organization soon became known as &quot;The March of Dimes Foundation&quot;, referring to polio victims&apos; inability to walk, and successfully collected a substantial amount of donations for vaccine research and its &apos;Iron Lung&apos; distribution program.</p><p>Years of research went into the effort to develop an effective vaccine. The chart below shows the large increase in scientific publications on polio in the 1950s.</p><p>The medical doctor and virologist Jonas Salk put forward a promising vaccine and in the spring of 1953, the foundation rolled out a large-scale trial of the Salk vaccine for which 1.83 million children in 44 US states received either a placebo or the vaccine shot.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a> Salk&apos;s supervisor Thomas Francis insisted to introduce a control group into the trial design and thereby paved the way for Randomized Control Trials, which have become a very influential method in medical and social science research in the following decades. The foundation was supported mainly by donations from the American people, who were collecting dimes, quarters, and dollars for decades in the hope of research finally uncovering a way to protect oneself against polio. Oshinsky (2005) even reports that the foundation received donations from two-thirds of the US population and a poll claims that more Americans knew about the field trials than about the president&apos;s full name (Dwight David Eisenhower).<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a></p><p>On April 12, 1955, the tenth anniversary of Roosevelt&apos;s death, Francis announced that Salk&apos;s vaccine was effective and potent in preventing polio. Within just two hours, the US Public Health Service issued a production license and the foundation prepared for a national immunization program. The conference had been live-broadcasted to physicians all over the country who had gathered in movie theaters to watch the announcement, millions of Americans received the news over the radio, spontaneously putting down their work in celebration of the news.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a> At 10:30PM of the same day, Thomas Francis and Jonas Salk gave a televised live broadcast interview in which Salk, when asked who owned the patents to the vaccine, famously answered <em>&quot;Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?&quot;</em><a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a> His answer was in the spirit of the foundation having funded the vaccine research with American&apos;s private donations and his conviction that life-saving technology should be for the benefit of society as a whole rather than for private financial gains.</p><p>Shortly afterwards Dr. Albert Sabin introduced a live polio vaccine that could be administered orally (rather than Salk&apos;s by injection), the oral polio vaccine (OPV).<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a> While Salk&apos;s vaccine only protected the central nervous system, Sabin&apos;s vaccine also protected the digestive tract and thereby prevented the spread of the wild polio virus more effectively. The easier administration also made vaccination efforts less expensive as it did not require trained health workers. For these reasons, OPV has been used around the world and it is the vaccination that is responsible for the dramatic reduction in polio infections globally that we document below.</p><p>The graph of the number of reported polio cases and deaths in the United States shown above shows the impact the national immunization scheme had: Within 7 years, the number of reported polio cases went below 1,000 and by 1979 the US was declared polio-free.

</h6><h4 id="vaccine-induced-polio"><a class="deep-link" href="#vaccine-induced-polio"></a>Vaccine-induced polio</h4><p>Unfortunately it is possible that the altered live poliovirus that is used in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and thereby regains its &#x201C;neurovirulence&#x201D;. Thankfully it happens extremely rarely (more below), but it means that recipients of the OPV can develop the paralytic symptoms from the vaccine.</p><p>There exist two types of vaccine-induced polio, VAPP and cVDPV:</p><ul>
<li>If the mutation is spontaneous, one refers to <em>Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Polio</em> (VAPP) which is not infectious. It is estimated that it occurs once per 2.7 million doses of OPV.<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></li>
<li>If the mutation happens over the course of at least one year by transmission among an under-immunized community, the virus can transform to resemble the wild type of poliovirus. This is then known as a <em>circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus</em> (cVDPV) and this virus can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route to other humans. Since 2000, 10 billion doses of OPV have been distributed worldwide and only 24 cVDPV outbreaks have occurred, counting less than 760 cases.<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a> As the attenuated vaccine virus requires conditions of low vaccine coverage to develop into a VDPV, it is not the vaccine itself, but low immunization rates that pose the problem.</li>
</ul><p>The chart below shows the number of circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (cVDPV) outbreaks between 2000 and May 2016. More than 90% of the vaccine-derived viruses were of serotype 2, a variation of the virus whose wild-type equivalent was already globally eradicated in 1999. Therefore, the <em>Global Polio Eradication Initiative</em> switched from an OPV that protects against all three serotypes to one that only protects against serotypes 1 and 3 in April 2016 and this has led to a dramatic decline in vaccine-derived polio viruses.</p><p>Further below, in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#health-benefits">section II.4 The benefits of eradicating polio</a>, we show that since 1988 16 million cases of paralytic polio have been averted thanks to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative&apos;s (GPEI) vaccination campaigns.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a> Moreover, the initiative has declared it its goal of switching to the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), an updated version of the Salk vaccine, which is administered by injection and does not bear the risk of vaccine-derived polio strands.</p><h6>The global number of circulating Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (cVDPV), January 2000 - May 2016<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vaccine-derived-Polio-Virus-decline.gif" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-14342" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Vaccine-derived-Polio-Virus-decline-750x429.gif" alt="Vaccine derived Polio Virus decline" width="750" height="429"></a></p><h4 id="polio-prevalence-in-the-developing-world-and-the-global-spread-of-the-polio-vaccine"><a class="deep-link" href="#polio-prevalence-in-the-developing-world-and-the-global-spread-of-the-polio-vaccine"></a>Polio prevalence in the developing world and the global spread of the polio vaccine</h4><p>Dr. Sabin&apos;s <em>Oral Poliovirus Vaccine</em> (OPV) was tested on more than 100 million people in the Soviet Union before obtaining its license in 1961. Because its production costs were lower and the oral administration easier, OPV was and still is the predominant vaccination serum in many countries. It was only during the 1970s and 1980s with several polio surveys throughout the developing world that became known as &quot;lameness surveys&quot; that it became apparent that polio was as much a problem in developing countries as it was in Western Europe and the United States.

They had achieved that by way of routine immunization programs which entails the basic schedule of each child receiving three Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) before its first birthday. Since its inauguration in 1988, the GPEI has offered support for these routine immunization programs to governments, but in addition to these the GPEI also ran</p><ul>
<li><em>National Immunization Days</em> (NIDs), on which children receive two doses of OPV 4-8 weeks apart regardless of their immunization history,</li>
<li><em>outbreak response immunization programs</em>, for which all children below the age of five years in the vicinity of a detected case of paralytic polio receive one OPV dose, and</li>
<li><em>mopping-up immunization programs</em>, during which under-five-year-olds living in outbreak-prone areas are visited in their homes and receive two OPV doses one month apart.</li>
</ul><p>Even though the GPEI has not yet reached the goal of eradicating polio, it has been successful in reducing the prevalence of polio around the world: reported polio cases have been reduced by 99.99% and two of its three serotypes have already been eradicated. In 2017 the polio virus is endemic in three countries only: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan &#x2013; colored in dark red in the map below. Up-to-date information on polio is available on the website of the GPEI <a href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/">here</a>.</p><p>Because of the increasing burden of <em>vaccine-derived paralytic polioviruses</em> (cVDPV), the GPEI has switched from the oral polio vaccine (OPV) against all three strands of poliovirus (see our explanation of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#vaccine-induced-polio">cVDPVs above</a>) to a &quot;bivalent&quot; OPV against only strands 1 and 3. Furthermore,&#xA0;in 2012 the initiative announced its goal of entirely phasing out <em>orally-administrated vaccines</em> (OPVs) and use only <em>injection-administrated vaccines</em> (IPVs) instead as part of the <a href="http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PEESP_EN_A4.pdf">Polio Eradication &amp; Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018</a>.

Even though polio was endemic in only Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2013, it proved especially difficult to monitor the virus and to reach every child for immunization in these contexts which makes the endgame strategy so expensive in comparison to the GPEI&apos;s previous budget.

The initiative hopes to especially finance the last stretch of vaccination campaigns in the three countries where polio is still endemic today (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria), keep the remaining countries, especially in the vicinity of the former, polio-free and closely monitor the occurrence for at least three years after the last reported case. Even though the additional financial needs seem very high, the GPEI argues that eradication is the most cost-effective strategy, by illustrating in their graphic reproduced below that the <em>long-term</em> costs of controlling rather than eradicating will be substantially higher.</p><p>The benefits of eradicating polio extend beyond the <em>health</em> domain of having less people suffering paralytic polio. In the <em>economic</em> domain, less polio patients translates into lower healthcare costs. Furthermore, once the virus has been eradicated, the world can stop the production and administration of&#xA0;the polio vaccine as well as the extensive surveillance of paralytic diseases suspected to be polio. The discontinuation of these costly activities will therefore result in extensive economic gains from eradication, as well. It is very difficult to accurately estimate these economic gains as it requires assumptions on for example the marginal economic value of a healthy person over a paralyzed polio patient or until what year you calculate these gains for. Tebbens et al.

<section><h2 id="data-quality-and-measurement"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-and-measurement"></a>Data Quality and Measurement</h2><p>With 72% of polio infections not leading to any symptoms &#x2013; and 99.5% of cases resulting in only temporary symptoms &#x2013; it would be extremely difficult to record all cases of polio. The number of detected polio cases is lower than the total number of cases and the gap is larger when monitoring was less complete in the past.</p><p>The set-up of the <em>Global Polio Eradication Initiative</em> brought about a global surveillance and monitoring framework that includes the counting of only those cases that resulted in permanent paralysis. Therefore, it should be taken into account that data on polio &#x2013; especially historical data &#x2013; is associated with considerable mismeasurement. This greatly inhibits our ability to compare the disease burden of polio historically across countries as well.<a id="ref-47" class="ref" href="#note-47"><sup>47</sup></a></p><h4 id="what-is-counted-as-a-polio-case"><a class="deep-link" href="#what-is-counted-as-a-polio-case"></a>What is counted as a &apos;polio case&apos;?</h4><p>As we have explained above, only 0.5% of polio infections lead to permanent paralysis. It is this subgroup of polio victims with the most severe symptoms &#x2013; paralysis &#x2013; that is cited in most discussions regarding the prevalence of polio. But unfortunately authors do not always make this clear, and instead of referring to the &apos;number of reported cases of polio&#x2019; &#x2013; as it is commonly done &#x2013; it would be accurate and more complete to speak of the &apos;number of reported <em>paralytic</em> cases of polio&#x2019; when this is what is actually referred to.</p><h4 id="data-quality-of-historical-sources-on-polio"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-of-historical-sources-on-polio"></a>Data quality of historical sources on polio</h4><p>The great variance in reporting standards even within countries was already nicely illustrated by Dauer in 1946.<a id="ref-48" class="ref" href="#note-48"><sup>48</sup></a> He compared the number of&#xA0;reported <em>deaths</em> due to polio with the number of reported <em>cases</em> of polio. The reproduced map below&#xA0;shows this ratio for each US state between 1940 and 1944. The national average of 11.2 cases per reported death was used as a benchmark and while the author acknowledges that some variation might be due to differences in virulence among different strains of the poliovirus, this variation is not powerful enough to explain such stark differences in the ratio across different parts of the USA. Instead, Dauer attributes these differences to varying reporting practices.&#xA0;Furthermore, in years of larger-scale polio outbreaks more non-paralytic cases are recorded than in years with smaller paralytic polio case counts.</p><p>In the past children&#x2019;s paralysis was often not correctly diagnosed as polio. Stool samples need to be&#xA0;analyzed to be able to distinguish paralytic symptoms from Guillain-Barr&#xE9; Syndrome, transverse myelitis, or traumatic neuritis.<a id="ref-49" class="ref" href="#note-49"><sup>49</sup></a></p><h6>Reported number of polio cases per polio deaths in the United States, 1940-1944<a id="ref-50" class="ref" href="#note-50"><sup>50</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Reported-Polio-cases-Data-Quality-USA.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14721 size-full" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Reported-Polio-cases-Data-Quality-USA.jpg" alt="Reported Polio cases Data Quality USA" width="713" height="576"></a></p><h4 id="quality-of-recent-data-on-polio"><a class="deep-link" href="#quality-of-recent-data-on-polio"></a>Quality of recent data on polio</h4><p>With the establishment of the <em>Global Polio Eradication Initiative</em> (GPEI) in 1988, monitoring and reporting procedures became standardized around the world.&#xA0;The GPEI&apos;s surveillance system relies on the detection of <em>acute flaccid paralysis</em> (AFP), which refers to paralytic symptoms more generally and is occurring in a population for reasons other than polio, such as trauma or&#xA0;Guillain-Barr&#xE9; syndrome (GBS). Having to report <em>all</em> cases of AFP in any child under 15 years of age means that a country with a good monitoring system in place should detect <a href="http://polioeradication.org/who-we-are/strategy/surveillance/" rel="noopener">at least 1 AFP case per 100,000 under-15-year-olds</a>. If the number of AFP cases is less than 1 per 100,000 under-15-year-olds then there is reason to suspect that paralytic polio cases too are underreported.</p><p>Each case of AFP should be followed by a diagnosis to find its cause. Within 14 days of the onset of AFP two stool samples should be collected 24 to 48 hours apart and need to be sent to a GPEI accredited laboratory to be tested for the poliovirus.<a id="ref-51" class="ref" href="#note-51"><sup>51</sup></a> Since 2000, the <a href="https://extranet.who.int/polis/public/CaseCount.aspx" rel="noopener">WHO reports</a> these surveillance quality indicators on a yearly basis for each country as the &quot;Non polio AFP Rate&quot; and &quot;% Adequate Stool Collection&quot;, respectively.</p><p>These WHO data were used for the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#economic-savings" rel="noopener">Tebbens et al. (2011) model on the economic benefits of polio&apos;s eradication</a> to generate an estimate of the <em>actual total</em> number of paralytic polio cases based on the <em>reported</em> number of paralytic polio cases and a correction factor for the share of not-reported paralytic polio cases. Graphic A below shows the correction factor the authors used &#x2013; the number of reported paralytic cases was multiplied by this factor to arrive at their estimate of the true total number of paralytic polio cases. The authors estimate that in the 1980s and 1990s the number of reported paralytic polio cases was around 7-fold lower than the true total number. One crucial piece of information for the estimation of this correction factor is that several developing countries administered surveys specifically on paralysis in the 1980s and arrived at paralytic polio case counts much higher than the initially reported figures.</p><p>As shown in Graphic B on the right below, Tebbens et al. (2011) estimate the total global number of paralytic polio cases to be around 270,000 per year in the late 1980s when the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-number-of-reported-polio-cases-by-world-region" rel="noopener">reported</a>&#xA0;number of cases&#xA0;only surmounts to around 30,000 paralytic cases per year.</p><p>Many official sources, such as the <a href="http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/AR2016_EN.pdf" rel="noopener">Annual Report of the GPEI in 2016</a>, cite the number of paralytic cases to be more than 350,000 in some years in the 1980s and accordingly estimate the correction factor to be even larger than 7. It is therefore even more remarkable that as reporting standards improved over time &#x2013; and a greater number of paralytic polio cases are detected and reported &#x2013; the number of paralytic polio cases dropped&#xA0;dramatically, so that only 42 paralytic polio cases were reported in 2016.</p><h6>Tebben et al.&apos;s (2011)<a id="ref-52" class="ref" href="#note-52"><sup>52</sup></a> correction factor and the resulting estimated total number of paralytic polio cases</h6><p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14492" src="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Correction-Factor-and-estimated-total-cases.png" alt="" width="3000" height="905"></a></p></section>

<p>This is taken from the Cambridge World History of Human Diseases (Figure VIII.110.3.)</h6>
<p>The source notes: “The figures are not entirely comparable: The Current Bibliography of Poliomyelitis includes some papers about other viruses; Index Medicus</p>
<p>puts the entry for a single paper in more than one section, so that the number of papers is overestimated by perhaps 5 percent. Entries in the Bibliography of Infantile Paralysis are listed by year of publication, whereas other bibliographies list entries by year of appearance in the secondary serial (e.g., 6 months later). The effects of world wars, slumps, large epidemics, and notable research findings are apparent (see J. R. Paul 1971). The peak of papers in 1984 is due to an international conference held in 1983.”</p></li><li id="note-26"><p>GPEI.
