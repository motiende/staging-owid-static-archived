<section><h2 id="empirical-view"><a class="deep-link" href="#empirical-view"></a>Empirical View</h2><p>The 1990s saw a substantial increase in the number of people infected with HIV and dying of AIDS. In 1997, almost 3.5 million people were diagnosed with HIV per year. After 1997, the number of new diagnoses began to decline and in 2015 it was reduced to 2.1 million per year.</p><p>The number of AIDS-related deaths increased throughout the 1990s and reached a peak in 2004, 2005 when in both years 2 million people died. Since then the annual number of deaths from AIDS declined as well and a decade later it was almost halved when 1.1 million people died in 2015.</p><p>The chart also shows the continuing increase in the number of people living with HIV. The rate of increase has slowed down compared to the 1990s but the absolute number reached a peak in 2015 when 36.7 million people were living with HIV globally.</p><h6>Global number of AIDS-related deaths, new HIV Infections, and People living with HIV (1990-2015)<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

The trend in AIDS-related deaths shows the opposite: more men tend to to die from AIDS every year than women. The reasons for differences in prevalence and death rates are complex; however, in general, across Sub-Saharan Africa women tend to be infected with HIV earlier than men and survive longer (explaining both the higher prevalence and lower annual AIDS deaths in women). There are a number of gender inequality and social norm issues which result in higher prevalence of HIV in females across many countries; women are at greater risk when they have a limited role in sexual decision-making and protection, role rates of sexual education and higher rates of transactional sex<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p><h4 id="differences-of-hiv-prevalence-between-men-and-women"><a class="deep-link" href="#differences-of-hiv-prevalence-between-men-and-women"></a>Differences of HIV prevalence between men and women</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-women-among-the-population-living-with-hiv?year=2015" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-women-among-the-population-living-with-hiv?year=2015" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-of-women-among-the-population-living-with-hiv-bcffd56fc30cbe3f00318082d3e10362_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-hiv-percentage-of-males-and-females-ages-15-24-infected-with-hiv" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-hiv-percentage-of-males-and-females-ages-15-24-infected-with-hiv" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/prevalence-of-hiv-percentage-of-males-and-females-ages-15-24-infected-with-hiv_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h4 id="differences-in-aids-deaths-in-men-and-women"><a class="deep-link" href="#differences-in-aids-deaths-in-men-and-women"></a>Differences in AIDS deaths in men and women</h4><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/aids-deaths-in-male-vs-female-adults" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/aids-deaths-in-male-vs-female-adults" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/aids-deaths-in-male-vs-female-adults_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>

<section><h2 id="data-quality-definition"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definition"></a>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2><h3 id="terminology-and-definitions"><a class="deep-link" href="#terminology-and-definitions"></a>Terminology and Definitions</h3><p>The following terminology and definitions are sourced from the UNAIDS organization.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p><strong>HIV</strong>: Human Immunodeficiency Virus.&#xA0;HIV is a virus that weakens the immune system, ultimately leading to AIDS.</p><p><strong>AIDS</strong>:&#xA0;acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.</p><p><strong>Antiretroviral medicines/ Antiretrovirals (ARVs)/ Antiretroviral therapy (ART)/ HIV treatment</strong>: &quot;Antiretroviral therapy is highly active in suppressing viral replication, reducing the amount of the virus in the blood to undetectable levels and slowing the progress of HIV disease. The usual antiretroviral therapy regimen combines three or more different medicines, such as two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and a protease inhibitor, two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or other combinations.</p><p>More recently, entry inhibitors and integrase inhibitors have joined the range of treatment options. Suboptimal regimens are monotherapy and dual therapy. The term highly active antiretroviral therapy was commonly used after the demonstration of excellent virological and clinical response to combinations of three (or more) antiretroviral medicines. Highly active is not needed as a qualification, however, and the term is no longer commonly used.</p><p>ARV refers to antiretroviral medicines. It should only be used when referring to the medicines themselves and not to their use.&quot;</p><p><strong>ARV-based prevention</strong>: &quot;ARV-based prevention includes the oral or topical use of antiretroviral medicines to prevent the acquisition of HIV in HIV-negative persons (such as the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis or post-exposure prophylaxis) or to reduce the transmission of HIV from people living with HIV (treatment as prevention).&quot;</p><p><strong>Epidemic</strong>: &quot;An epidemic refers to a disease condition affecting (or tending to affect) a disproportionately large number of individuals within a population, community or region at the same time. The population may be all of the inhabitants of a given geographic area, the population of a school or similar institution or everyone of a certain age or sex (such as the children or women of a region). An epidemic may be restricted to one locale (an outbreak), be more general (an epidemic) or be global (a pandemic). Common diseases that occur at a constant but relatively high rate in the population are said to be endemic.&quot;</p><p><strong>HIV-negative (seronegative)</strong>: &quot;A person who is HIV-negative (also known as seronegative) shows no evidence of HIV in a blood test (e.g. there is an absence of antibodies against HIV). The test result of a person who has acquired HIV but is in the window period between HIV exposure and detection of antibodies also will be negative.&quot;</p><p><strong>HIV-positive (seropositive)</strong>: &quot;A person who is HIV-positive (or seropositive) has had antibodies against HIV detected in a blood test or gingival exudate test (commonly known as a saliva test). Results may occasionally be false-positive, especially in infants up to 18 months of age who are carrying maternal antibodies.&quot;</p><p><strong>Incidence</strong>: &quot;HIV incidence is expressed as the number of new HIV infections over the number of people susceptible to infection in a specified time period. Cumulative incidence may be expressed as the number of new cases arising in a given period in a specified population. UNAIDS reports the estimated number of incident cases that occurred in the past year among people aged 15&#x2013;49 years and 0&#x2013;14 years.&quot;</p><p><strong>Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT)</strong>: &quot;MTCT is the abbreviation for mother-to-child transmission. PMTCT, the abbreviation for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, refers to a four-prong strategy for stopping new HIV infections among children and keeping their mothers alive and families healthy. The four prongs are: helping reproductive-age women avoid HIV (prong 1); reducing unmet need for family planning (prong 2); providing antiretroviral medicine prophylaxis to prevent HIV transmission during pregnancy, labour and delivery, and breastfeeding (prong 3); and providing care, treatment and support for mothers and their families (prong 4).</p><p>PMTCT often is mistakenly used to refer to only prong 3&#x2014; the provision of antiretroviral medicine prophylaxis. Some countries prefer to use the terms parent-to-child transmission or vertical transmission as more inclusive terms to avoid stigmatizing pregnant women, to acknowledge the role of the father/male sexual partner in transmitting HIV to the woman and to encourage male involvement in HIV prevention. Still other countries and organizations use the term elimination of mother-to-child transmission (eMTCT).&quot;</p><p><strong>Prevalence</strong>: &quot;Usually given as a percentage, HIV prevalence quantifies the proportion of individuals in a population who are living with HIV at a specific point in time. HIV prevalence also can refer to the number of people living with HIV. UNAIDS normally reports HIV prevalence among people aged 15&#x2013;49 years.&quot;</p><p><strong>Tuberculosis (TB)</strong>: &quot;Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading HIV-associated opportunistic infection in low- and middle- income countries, and it is a leading cause of death globally among people living with HIV. The term HIV-associated tuberculosis or HIV-associated TB should be used, rather than the shorthand HIV/TB, in order to distinguish such instances from tuberculosis per se.</p><p>The main strategies to reduce the burden of HIV in TB patients are HIV testing (for people whose HIV status is unknown) and the provision of antiretroviral therapy and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) (for people living with HIV). The main activities to reduce TB among people living with HIV are regular screening for TB among people in HIV care and the provision of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) and ART to HIV-positive people without active TB who meet eligibility criteria.&quot;</p><h3 id="comparisons-of-unaids-and-ihme-estimates"><a class="deep-link" href="#comparisons-of-unaids-and-ihme-estimates"></a>Comparisons of UNAIDS and IHME estimates</h3><p>A number of sources publish estimates on HIV and AIDS - two of the most established (which are presented in this entry) are UNAIDS and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Global Burden of Disease.
