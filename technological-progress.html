<p>In the chart below we see this series in interactive form, updated to the year 2017. This measures the growth of supercomputer power in terms of the number of floating-point operations carried out per second (FLOPS) by the largest supercomputer in any given year. (FLOPS) is a measure of calculations per second forfloating-point operations. Floating-point operations are needed for very large or very small real numbers, or computationsthat require a large dynamic range. It is therefore a more accurate measured than simply instructions per second.</p>

This non-linearity is observed most clearly in examples which show rapid evolution following an important enabling innovation. Below we have included two examples of such trends: the take-off of human flight, and the sequencing of the human genome.</p><p>In the chart below we have plotted the global distance record set by non-commercial flights since 1800. This record represents the maximum distance a non-commercial powered aircraft has traveled without refueling. We see that prior to 1900, humans had not yet developed the technology necessary to enable powered flight. It wasn&apos;t until 1903 that the <a href="http://wrightbrothers.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wright Brothers</a>&#xA0;were able to engineer the first powered flying technology. This initial innovation sparked continued, rapid progress in modern aviation, with the record distance increasing nearly 150,000-fold from 0.28 kilometres in 1903 to just under 41,500 kilometres in 2006.</p><p>This provides one examples of non-linear evolution of technological change: a single enabler shifted us from a civilization unable to fly, to one which could. Progress in aviation- and space exploration- has been rapid since.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/non-commercial-flight-distance-records" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/non-commercial-flight-distance-records" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/non-commercial-flight-distance-records_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="the-non-linearity-of-technological-change-human-genome-dna-sequencing"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-non-linearity-of-technological-change-human-genome-dna-sequencing"></a>The non-linearity of technological change: human genome DNA sequencing</h3><p>Another example which demonstrates this non-linear progress is the field of human genome DNA sequencing.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> The <a href="http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human Genome Project (HGP)</a>,which aimed to determine and map the complete set of nucleotide base pairs which make up human DNA (which total more than three billion) ran over 13 years from 1990-2003. This initial discovery and determination of the human genome sequence was a crucial injection point in the field of DNA sequencing.</p><p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/sequencingcostsdata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP)</a>, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cost-per-megabase-mb-of-human-genome-dna-sequencing">cost of sequencing</a> DNA bases has fallen dramatically (more than 175,000-fold) since the completion of the first sequencing project. Note that this costing refers to the price of raw base pairs of DNA sequence; the cost of producing the full human genome is higher than the sum of 30 million base pairs would suggest. This is because some redundant sequence coverage would be necessary to achieve and assemble the full genome. Nonetheless, this rapid decline in cost is also <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cost-of-sequencing-a-full-human-genome">observed in prices</a> for the sequencing of a complete human genome.</p><p>This can also be observed in another way: in the chart below we have plotted the number of human genome base pairs which can be sequenced for one US$. In the early 2000s, we could sequence in the order of hundreds of base pairs per US$. Since 2008, we have seen a dramatic decline in the cost of sequencing, allowing us to now produce more than 33 million base pairs per US$.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-human-genome-base-pairs-sequenced-per-us" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-human-genome-base-pairs-sequenced-per-us" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/number-of-human-genome-base-pairs-sequenced-per-us_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="increasing-product-quality-for-a-decreasing-price"><a class="deep-link" href="#increasing-product-quality-for-a-decreasing-price"></a>Increasing product quality for a decreasing price</h3><p>Increasing computational power - and increasing product quality&#xA0;- matters indeed more than a mere doubling of transistors. But if the technologically-advanced products are prohibitively expensive then they can only have a limited impact on the whole society. For this reason, it is interesting to look at both the product quality and the price.&#xA0;The author and inventor Ray Kurzweil analyzed the change of price and quality for computing machines since 1900. He not only analyzed the improvements of integrated circuits but also looked at the predecessors - earlier transistors, vacuum tubes, relays and electromechanical computers. What he found is that&#xA0;Moore did not only make a valid prediction of the future, but his description is also valid for the past!&#xA0;The exponential growth rate that Moore picked up in the 1960s was driving technological progress since the beginning of the century.</p><p>The following graph shows&#xA0;the computer power that consumers could purchase for a price of $1000. It is especially insightful if one wants to understand how technological progress mattered as a driver of social change.</p><h6>Calculations per second per $1000 - exponential growth of computing for 110 years &#x2013;&#xA0;Kurzweil<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></h6><p style="text-align: left;"><a href="//ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/Calculations-per-Second-per-1000-Exponential-Growth-of-Computing-for-110-years-Kurzweil.png" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-1480 aligncenter" src="//ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/05/Calculations-per-Second-per-1000-Exponential-Growth-of-Computing-for-110-years-Kurzweil.png" alt="Calculations per Second per 1000$ - Exponential Growth of Computing for 110 years - Kurzweil" width="802" height="540" srcset="/uploads/2013/05/Calculations-per-Second-per-1000-Exponential-Growth-of-Computing-for-110-years-Kurzweil-150x150.png 150w, /uploads/2013/05/Calculations-per-Second-per-1000-Exponential-Growth-of-Computing-for-110-years-Kurzweil-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p style="text-align: left;">The extension of the time frame also makes clear how our modern computers evolved.

Positive values indicate an increase in prices since 1997, and negative values represent a price decline. Here we see a distinct divide between consumer durables and technologies (which have typically seen a price decline), and service-based purchases (which have increased in price).</p><p>A combination of industrial offshoring, technological innovation and economies of scale have resulted in a price decline in goods such as televisions (-96% since 1997), software (-67%), toys (-69%), and clothing (-4%). In contrast, the prices of goods and services such as education, childcare, medical care, and housing have increased significantly, rising by 150%, 110%, 100% and 58%, respectively.</p><p>The observed rise in costs of services may be partly attributed to the so-called &apos;<a href="http://www.robertoformato.it/uploads/2016/11/03-Baumol-cost-disease-by-Heilbrun.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baumol&apos;s cost disease</a>&apos;, which is an important exception from the general regularity that the&#xA0;pay for labor &#x2013; the wage &#x2013; reflects the productivity of labor. Baumol&apos;s cost disease describes the phenomenon whereby wages rise in jobs which have experienced little improvements in labor productivity in order to compete with salaries in other sectors.</p><p>Examples of service-based roles such as nursing, healthcare, childcare and education have experienced little productivity growth relative to manufacturing sectors which have seen continued improvements through technological innovation. In order to retain employees in service-based roles, salaries have risen in order to remain competitive with industrial sectors; this increase in pay has occurred despite minimal gains in productivity. This may in part explain why the cost of education, healthcare and other services have risen faster than the general rate of inflation.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/price-changes-in-consumer-goods-and-services-in-the-usa-1997-2017_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><h3 id="exponential-increase-in-computing-efficiency"><a class="deep-link" href="#exponential-increase-in-computing-efficiency"></a>Exponential increase in computing efficiency</h3><p>The cost to keep the machine running also matters.

Butters&apos; Law says the amount of data one can transmit using optical fiber is doubling every nine months,&#xA0;which you can convert&#xA0;and say that the cost of transmission by optical fiber is halving every nine months.&#xA0;Rose&apos;s Law describes the exponential growth of the number of qubits of quantum computers.
