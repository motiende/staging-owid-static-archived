Here is an overview of the main points we cover below.</p><ul>
<li>Over the last two centuries trade has grown remarkably, completely transforming the global economy. Today about one fourth of total global production is exported. Understanding this transformative process is important because trade has generated gains, but it has also had important distributional consequences.

<li>From a historical perspective, there have been two waves of globalization. The first wave started in the 19th century, and came to an end with the beginning of the First World War. The second wave started after the Second World War, and is still continuing. [<a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/trade-and-globalization#the-two-waves-of-globalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jump to this section</a>]</li>
<li>Trade transactions include both goods (tangible products that are physically shipped) and services (intangible commodities, such as tourism and financial services). The production chains for these goods and services are becoming increasingly complex and global. According to recent estimates, about 30% of the value of global exports comes from foreign inputs. [<a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/trade-and-globalization#trade-around-the-world-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jump to this section</a>]</li>
<li>Most trade theories in the economics literature focus on sources of comparative advantage. These theories postulate that all nations can gain from trade if each specializes in producing what they are relatively more efficient at producing, based on their strengths. The empirical evidence shows that comparative advantage is indeed relevant; but it is not the only force driving incentives to specialization and trade.

This process of integration, often called Globalization, has materialized in a remarkable growth in trade between countries.</p><p>The following chart shows the value of world exports over the period 1800-2014. These estimates are in constant prices (i.e. have been adjusted to account for inflation) and are indexed at 1913 values.</p><p>This chart shows an extraordinary growth in international trade over the last couple of centuries: Exports today are more than 4,000-times larger than in 1913.</p><p>You can click on the option marked &apos;Linear&apos;, on top of the vertical axis, to change into a logarithmic scale.

Today, the value of exported goods around the world is close to 25%. This shows that over the last hundred years of economic growth, there has been more than proportional growth in global trade.</p><p><em>(NB.

As a consequence, local markets respond, and prices change. This has an impact on households, both as consumers and as wage earners.</p><p>The implication is that trade has an impact on everyone. It&apos;s not the case that the effects are restricted to workers from industries in the trade sector; or to consumers who buy imported goods. The effect of trade extends to everyone because markets are interlinked, so imports and exports have knock-on effects on all prices in the economy, including those in non-traded sectors.</p><p>Economists usually distinguish between &quot;general equilibrium consumption effects&quot; (i.e. changes in consumption that arise from the fact that trade affects the prices of non-traded goods relative to traded goods) and &quot;general equilibrium income effects&quot; (i.e. changes in wages that arise from the fact that trade has an impact on the demand for specific types of workers, who could be employed in both the traded and non-traded sectors).</p><p>Considering all these complex interrelations, it&apos;s not surprising that economic theories predict that not everyone will benefit from international trade in the same way. The distribution of the gains from trade depends on what different groups of people consume, and which types of jobs they have, or could have.</p><p><em>(NB. You can read more about these economic concepts, and the related predictions from economic theory, in Chapter 18 of the textbook <a href="https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/18.html&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economy: Economics for a Changing World</a>.)</em></p><h4 id="overview-of-the-evidence"><a class="deep-link" href="#overview-of-the-evidence"></a>Overview of the evidence</h4><p>We review the empirical evidence in detail in a <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/trade-wages-cost-living" target="_blank" rel="noopener">related blog post</a>. Here is an overview:</p><ul>
<li>For some groups of people, trade has a negative effect on wages and employment opportunities; and at the same time it has a positive effect via lower consumer prices and increased availability of products.</li>
<li>For some households, the net effect is positive. But for other households that&apos;s not the case. In particular, workers who lose their job can be affected for extended periods of time, so the positive effect via lower prices is not enough to compensate them for the reduction in earnings.</li>
<li>On the whole, if we aggregate changes in welfare across households, the net effect is often positive. But this is hardly a consolation for those who are worse off.</li>
<li>This highlights a complex reality: There are <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/trade-and-econ-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate gains from trade</a>, but there are also real distributional concerns. Even if <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/trade-and-income-inequality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trade is not a major driver of income inequalities</a>, it&apos;s important to keep in mind that public policies, such as unemployment benefits and other safety-net programs, can and should help redistribute the gains from trade.</li>
</ul><h4 id="an-example-the-impact-of-foreign-retail-chains-on-mexican-households"><a class="deep-link" href="#an-example-the-impact-of-foreign-retail-chains-on-mexican-households"></a>An example: the impact of foreign retail chains on Mexican households</h4><p>In a recent study, the economists David Atkin, Benjamin Faber, and Marco Gonzalez-Navarro explored the impact that the arrival of global retail chains had on workers and consumers in Mexico.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>In this study Atkin and coauthors find that the arrival of global retail chains led to reductions in the incomes of traditional retail sector workers. However, they find little impact on average municipality-level incomes or employment; and a large positive impact on both rich and poor households, via lower costs of living. The following chart shows the estimated distribution of total welfare gains across the household income distribution (the light-gray lines correspond to confidence intervals). These are proportional gains, and are expressed as percent of initial household income.</p><p>As we can see, there is a net positive welfare effect across all income groups; but these improvements in welfare are regressive, in the sense that richer households gain proportionally more (about 7.5 percent gain compared to 5 percent).<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><h6>Distribution of total household welfare gains from the arrival of foreign retail chains in Mexico &#x2013; Atkin, Faber, and Gonzalez-Navarro (2018)</h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2018/09/Atkin-et-al-2018-lower-opacity.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21011" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2018/09/Atkin-et-al-2018-lower-opacity-699x550.png" alt="Atkin et al 2018 lower opacity" width="699" height="550" srcset="/uploads/2018/09/Atkin-et-al-2018-lower-opacity-150x118.png 150w, /uploads/2018/09/Atkin-et-al-2018-lower-opacity-400x315.png 400w, /uploads/2018/09/Atkin-et-al-2018-lower-opacity-699x550.png 699w, /uploads/2018/09/Atkin-et-al-2018-lower-opacity-768x605.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p></section>

It is precisely this that distinguishes absolute advantage from comparative advantage.</p><p>To see the difference between comparative and absolute advantage, consider a commercial aviation pilot and a baker. Suppose the pilot is an excellent chef, and she can bake just as well, or even better than the baker. In this case, the pilot has an absolute advantage in both tasks. Yet the baker probably has a comparative advantage in baking, because the opportunity cost of baking is much higher for the pilot.</p><p>The freely available economics textbook <a href="https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/18.html&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economy: Economics for a Changing World</a> explains this as follows: <em>&quot;A person or country has comparative advantage in the production of a particular good, if the cost of producing an additional unit of that good relative to the cost of producing another good is lower than another person or country&#x2019;s cost to produce the same two goods.&quot;</em></p><p>At the individual level, comparative advantage explains why you might want to delegate tasks to someone else, even if you can do those tasks better and faster than them. This may sound counterintuitive, but it is not: If you are good at many things, it means that investing time in one task has a high opportunity cost, because you are not doing the other amazing things you could be doing with your time and resources. So, at least from an efficiency point of view, you should specialize on what you are best at, and delegate the rest.</p><p>The same logic applies to countries. Broadly speaking, the principle of comparative advantage postulates that all nations can gain from trade if each specializes in producing what they are relatively more efficient at producing, and import the rest: &#x201C;do what you do best, import the rest&#x201D;.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a></p><p>In countries with relative abundance of certain factors of production, the theory of comparative advantage predicts that they will export goods that rely heavily in those factors: a country typically has a comparative advantage in those goods that use more intensively its abundant resources. Colombia exports bananas to Europe because it has comparatively abundant tropical weather. Under autarky, Colombia would find it cheap to produce bananas relative to e.g. apples.</p><h4 id="evidence-is-there-empirical-support-for-comparative-advantage-theories-of-trade"><a class="deep-link" href="#evidence-is-there-empirical-support-for-comparative-advantage-theories-of-trade"></a>Evidence: Is there empirical support for comparative-advantage theories of trade?</h4><p>The empirical evidence suggests that the principle of comparative advantage does help explain trade patterns. Bernhofen and Brown (2004)<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a>, for instance, provide evidence using the experience of Japan. Specifically, they exploit Japan&#x2019;s dramatic nineteenth-century move from a state of near complete isolation to wide trade openness.</p><p>The following graph shows the price changes of the key tradable goods after the opening up to trade. It presents a scatter diagram of the net exports in 1869 graphed in relation to the change in prices from 1851&#x2013;53 to 1869. As we can see, this is consistent with the theory: after opening to trade, the relative prices of major exports such as silk increased (Japan exported what was cheap for them to produce and which was valuable abroad), while the relative price of imports such as sugar declined (they imported what was relatively more difficult for them to produce, but was cheap abroad).</p><h6>Net exports and price changes for 1869, Japan &#x2013; Figure 4 in Bernhofen and Brown (2014)<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8677 size-large" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-750x487.png" alt="japan_bernhoffenbrown2014" width="750" height="487" srcset="/uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-32x32.png 32w, /uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-50x50.png 50w, /uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-64x64.png 64w, /uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-96x96.png 96w, /uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-128x128.png 128w, /uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-150x97.png 150w, /uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-400x260.png 400w, /uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-750x487.png 750w, /uploads/2016/09/Japan_BernhoffenBrown2014-768x499.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><h3 id="trade-diminishes-with-distance"><a class="deep-link" href="#trade-diminishes-with-distance"></a>Trade diminishes with distance</h3><p>The resistance that geography imposes on trade has long been studied in the empirical economics literature &#x2013; and the main conclusion is that trade intensity is strongly linked to geographic distance.</p><p>The following visualization, from Eaton and Kortum (2002)<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a>, graphs &apos;normalized import shares&apos; against distance.

As we can see, there is a strong negative relationship. Trade diminishes with distance. Through econometric modeling, the paper shows that this relationship is not just a correlation driven by other factors: their findings suggest that distance imposes a significant barrier to trade.</p><h6>Import share and distance between country pairs, OECD, 1990 &#x2013; Figure 1 in Eaton and Kortum (2002)<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></h6><p><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21371" src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-778x550.png" alt="eatonkortum2002_tradedistance" width="778" height="550" srcset="/uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-150x106.png 150w, /uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-400x283.png 400w, /uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-768x543.png 768w, /uploads/2018/10/eaton-kortum-distance-and-geography-778x550.png 778w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></p><p>The fact that trade diminishes with distance is also corroborated by data of trade intensity within countries.

<section><h2 id="measurement-and-data-quality"><a class="deep-link" href="#measurement-and-data-quality"></a>Measurement and data quality</h2><p>There are dozens of official sources of data on international trade. If you compare these different sources, you will find that they do not agree with one another. Even if you focus on what seems to be the same indicator for the same year in the same country, discrepancies are large.</p><p>For example, for China in 2010, the estimated total value of goods exports was $1.48 trillion according to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.GSR.MRCH.CD?locations=CN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Bank Data</a>, but it was $1.58 trillion according to <a href="http://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=61545870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WTO Data.</a> That&apos;s a difference of about 7%, or a hundred billion US dollars.</p><p>Such differences between sources can also be found for rich countries where statistical agencies tend to follow international reporting guidelines more closely. In Italy, for example, Eurostat figures of the value of exported goods in 2015 are 10% higher than the merchandise trade figures published by the OECD.</p><p>And there are also large bilateral discrepancies within sources. According to IMF data, for example, the value of goods that Canada reports exporting to the US is almost $20 billion more that the value of goods that the US reports importing from Canada.</p><p>In this section we explain how international trade data is collected and processed, and why there are such large discrepancies.</p><h3 id="how-large-are-discrepancies-between-sources"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-large-are-discrepancies-between-sources"></a>How large are discrepancies between sources?</h3><p>In the visualization below we provide a comparison of the data published by several of the sources listed above, country by country, since 1955 up until today.</p><p>For each country, we exclude trade in services, and we focus only on estimates of the total value of exported goods, expressed as shares of GDP.<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a></p><p>As we can clearly see in this chart, different data sources tell often very different stories.

<li>The first approach relies on estimating trade from <em>customs records</em>, often complementing or correcting figures with data from enterprise surveys and administrative records associated with taxation. The main manual providing guidelines for this approach is the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/50154/IMTS-Publication-List" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Merchandise Trade Statistics Manual</a> (IMTS).</li>
<li>The second approach relies on estimating trade from <em>macroeconomic data</em>, typically <em>National Accounts</em>. The main manual providing guidelines for this approach is the <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2007/bopman6.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual</a> (BPM6), which was drafted in parallel with the 2008 <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/docs/sna2008.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">System of National Accounts of the United Nations</a> (SNA 2008). The idea behind this approach is recording changes in economic ownership.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a></li>
</ul><p>Under these two approaches, it is common to distinguish between &apos;traded merchandise&apos; and &apos;traded goods&apos;. The distinction is often made because goods simply being transported through a country (i.e. goods in transit) are not considered to change the stock of material resources of a country, and are hence often excluded from the more narrow concept of &apos;merchandise trade&apos;.</p><p>Also, adding to the complexity, countries often rely on measurement protocols that are developed alongside these approaches and concepts that are not perfectly compatible to begin with. In Europe, for example, countries use the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/KS-02-17-333" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&apos;Compilers guide on European statistics on international trade in goods&apos;.</a></p><h4 id="measurement-error-and-other-inconsistencies"><a class="deep-link" href="#measurement-error-and-other-inconsistencies"></a>Measurement error and other inconsistencies</h4><p>Even when two sources rely on the same broad accounting approach, discrepancies arise because countries fail to adhere perfectly to the protocols.</p><p>In theory, for example, the exports of country A to country B should mirror the imports of country B from country A. But in practice this is rarely the case because of differences in valuation. According to the BPM6, imports and exports should be recorded in the balance of payments accounts on a &apos;<em>free on board</em> (FOB) basis&apos;, which means using prices that include all charges up to placing the goods on board a ship at the port of departure. Yet many countries stick to FOB values only for exports, and use CIF values for imports (CIF stands for &apos;Cost, Insurance and Freight&apos;, and includes the costs of transportation).<a id="ref-24" class="ref" href="#note-24"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p>The chart below gives you an idea of how large import-export asymmetries are. Shown are the differences between the value of goods that each country reports exporting to the US, and the value of goods that the US reports importing from the same countries. For example, for China, the figure in the chart corresponds to the &#x201C;Value of merchandise imports in the US from China&#x201D; minus &#x201C;Value of merchandise exports from China to the US&#x201D;.</p><p>The differences in the chart below, which are both positive and negative, suggest that there is more going on than differences in FOB vs CIF values. If all asymmetries were coming from CIF-FOB differences, then we should only see positive values in the chart (recall that, unlike FOB values, CIF values include the cost of transportation, so CIF values are larger).</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/difference-in-the-value-of-goods-exported-to-and-imported-by-the-us" class="grapherPreview"><a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/difference-in-the-value-of-goods-exported-to-and-imported-by-the-us" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/difference-in-the-value-of-goods-exported-to-and-imported-by-the-us_v6_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>What else is going on here?</p><p>Another common source of measurement error relates to the inconsistent attribution of trade partners. An example is failure to follow the guidelines on how to treat goods passing through intermediary countries for processing or merchanting purposes. As global production chains become more complex, countries find it increasingly difficult to unambiguously establish the origin and final destination of merchandise, even when rules are established in the manuals. <a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p><p>And there are still more potential sources of discrepancies. For example differences in customs and tax regimes, and differences between &quot;general&quot; and &quot;special&quot; trade systems (i.e. differences between statistical territories and actual country borders, which do not often coincide because of things like &apos;custom free zones&apos;).<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a></p><p>Even when two sources have identical trade estimates, inconsistencies in published data can arise from differences in exchange rates. If a dataset reports cross-country trade data in US dollars, estimates will vary depending on the exchange rates used. Different exchange rates will lead to conflicting estimates, even if figures in local currency units are consistent.</p></section>

<p>Indeed, if you compare the chart showing the <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/globalization-over-5-centuries-km" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global trade openness index</a> and the chart showing <a href="https://mispytest-owid.netlify.com/grapher/merchandise-exports-gdp-cepii?country=OWID_WRL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global merchandise exports as share of GDP</a>, you find that the former is almost twice as large as the latter.</p>
<p>Why is the global openness index not exactly twice the value reported in the chart plotting global merchandise exports? There a three reasons.</p>
<p>First, the global openness index uses different sources. Second, the global openness index includes trade in goods and services, while merchandise exports include goods but not services. And third, the amount that country A reports exporting to country B does not usually match the amount that B reports importing from A.</p>
